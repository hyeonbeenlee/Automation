Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study conducted on the performance of the commonly used object tracking and location prediction algorithms for mobile robot navigation in a dynamically cluttered and GPS-denied mining environment. The study was done to test the different algorithms for the same set criteria (such as accuracy and computational time) under the same conditions.The identified commonly used algorithms for object tracking and location prediction of moving objects used in this investigation are Kalman filter (KF), extended Kalman filter (EKF) and particle filter (PF). The study results of those algorithms are analyzed and discussed in this paper. A trade-off was apparent. However, in overall performance KF has shown its competitiveness.The result from the study has found that the KF based algorithm provides better performance in terms of accuracy in tracking dynamic objects under commonly used benchmarks. This finding can be used in development of an efficient robot navigation algorithm.

Abstract: Current mine automation efforts are not truly “manless” and as such miss the business benefits that a true “manless” mine would afford. There are some conditions and complex orebodies that necessitate truly “manless” operations in certain mining zones and there exists a business opportunity that true “manless” operations present. We have called this “Zero Entry Mining” because no human need enter the mining zone. Zero Entry Mining not only reduces risk exposure to personnel, but can also be a source of added economic value through higher utilization of equipment, reduced services (e.g. ventilation) and increased revenue through access to difficult to mine areas. In deep mining this might, for example, involve exploitation of ore at depth where steep pit walls, or mining underneath unsupported ground which may involve unacceptable risk for personnel to enter the mining zone. Ultimately zero entry mining will enable the complete redesign of mines, mining equipment and mining methods in ways that were not possible if personnel were in the mining zone. This paper discusses the economic benefits of zero-entry mining as well as developments necessary to enable its operations, including the systems integrity and technology support to deliver true zero-entry mining capability.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755051
Abstract: The simulation-based motion platforms (SBMPs) are useful devices to reproduce the motion feeling for a driver/piolet. The SBMPs are restricted due to limitations of the platforms' structures. These limitations lead discrepancy between visual and motion cues which can cause motion sickness. The motion cueing algorithm (MCA) is employed to reproduce motion cues of a real land and air vehicle in the SBMP within its physical limitations aiming to regenerate the realistic feeling for the SBMP's driver. Recently, coupled linear model predictive control-based motion cueing algorithms (MPC-based MCA) have been proposed with consideration of the human perception model including semicircular canals and otolith organs. The decoupled linear model predictive control including semicircular canals and otolith organs have been designed in this study for the first time to use the limited linear workspace of the Hexapod-based motion simulation platform more effectively. The results of both the existing coupled and new decoupled MPC-based MCAs are compared. Finally, it is shown that the decoupled linear MPC-based MCA is able to reduce the motion sensation error between the real vehicle and SBMP drivers and also use the limited linear motion simulation platform workspace more efficiently compared to the existing coupled linear MPC-based MCA.

Abstract: Accidents caused by a collision between an environment and a robot become a problem, so safety strategies of robots are indispensable. Since the impact force sharply increases at the time of a collision, position-based impedance control which has low responsiveness to the collision can not sufficiently reduce the damage. This paper proposes the manipulator with passive and flexible base for collision force suppression. The proposed flexible base has a rotating structure and it is possible to suppress the collision from any direction when an environment contacts the working manipulator. When a large external force is applied, the variable impedance control according to the strain amount of the base spring in order to avoid the strain limit of flexible base is proposed. Also, when the external force is estimated with force sensorless, the estimation error increases due to the friction model error of the motor, and the position followability deteriorates. Therefore, the contact state is judged by the strain amount of the flexible base, and correction is added to the estimated reaction force, thereby improving the position followability of the impedance control in non-contact.

Abstract: As researches on robots and robotic arms going further, human portrait painting robot appears as a typical art creation application. Traditional ways to achieve this goal mainly depend on the geometric and texture features with no semantic information. In this system, to enrich the portrait, key points of human faces are fused with gray scale information. During the process of drawing, different components of the portrait can be distinguished such as hair or eyes by strokes. Besides, sketch pattern is added to line drawing model using cluster algorithm and presents a unique style. The painted results combine outline and sketch characters different from preceding work and each costs less than two minutes to finish an outline portrait and 4-6 minutes with sketch pattern.

Abstract: Nowadays, a low birthrate and longevity are proceeding in developed countries. Due to the low birthrate and longevity, there is a shortage of caregivers. Therefore, an assistance of nursing care is necessary. Also, according to a multidisciplinary advance of robots, robots increase opportunities for operating in environment in which human intervene. Operating a robot in human presence is a dangerous for human. Therefore, a signal transmission between human and robots is necessary. This paper uses a cuff of sphygmomanometer as an interface of signal transmission. This interface is attached to an arm of user and an air pressure of interface is controlled to constant. An error between pressure command and response caused by a muscle bulge of user is regarded as an intention of user. An integration of error is given to a manipulator as a position command. According to this system, the interface user can operate a position of manipulator based on the user's intention.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755023
Abstract: This paper proposes a new artificial neural network-based position controller for a full-electric injection moulding machine. Such a controller improves the dynamic characteristics of the positioning for hot runners, pin valve and the injection motors for varying moulding parameters. Practical experimental data and Matlab's System Identification Toolbox have been used to identify the transfer functions of the motors. The structure of the artificial neural network, which used positioning error and speed of error, was obtained by numerical modelling in Matlab/Simulink. The artificial neural network was trained using back-propagation algorithms to provide control of the motor current thus ensuring the required position and velocity. The efficiency of the proposed ANN-based controller has been estimated and verified in Simulink using real velocity data and the position of the injection moulding machine and pin valve motors.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755064
Abstract: Many industrial applications of machining require a bounded tracking error during transient and steady processes. Traditional control architectures in machining are unable to explicitly bound tracking errors, and therefore conservative operation is required to ensure satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a model-predictive-based approach to guarantee bounded error tracking for the family of systems with available end effector position measurements. The state and input constraints and the bounded error requirements are satisfied by a model predictive controller (MPC) that enforces the system and reference states to remain in a polyhedral robust control invariant (RCI) set. We propose an algorithm for calculating this RCI set in a finite number of computation steps and give the formulation of the MPC. The superiority of the proposed control approach over a conventional tracking controller is demonstrated via simulation of a laboratory machine.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755149
Abstract: Direct-driven linear motor systems are widely used in high speed and high precision manufacturing, which is now urgently required for an optimal operation performance under constrain. The objectives of an optimal operation performance, including but not limited to, good robustness properties, high tracking accuracy, fast transient response. However, most existing controller design methodologies address one or two objectives only, let alone totally ignore disturbances and parametric uncertainties in their designs. In this paper, we present a two-layer strategy that could meet all the performance criteria and constraints, while consider the effects of disturbances and parametric uncertainties. The upper-layer computes the optimal replanned trajectory by solving nonlinear and non-convex optimization problems, since that the nonlinear dynamic model is directly embedded in the scheme, where a more aggressive replanned trajectory is obtained then. The lower-layer constructed an attractive domain to regulate the tracking, where the closed-loop states are forced to follow the optimal replanned trajectory sent by the upper-layer as close as possible, the stability and the disturbance rejection ability of the system is thus demonstrated theoretically. Comparative experiments are carried out also and the results further verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, which shows superior transient response over previous approach.

Abstract: Hexarot is a type of the axisymmetric parallel mechanisms which has become increasingly popular for use as high-G simulators. This paper presents the design and control system development of a hexarot simulator for high acceleration motions. The kinematic formulation of the mechanism is developed for the control system development of the manipulator. PID controller is then designed to extract the moments of active joints based on the inverse kinematics of the mechanism. The linear and angular positions of the manipulator are investigated for different frequencies. The obtained results show that the under-study mechanism is appropriate for a high-G motion simulator.

Abstract: This research proposes a damping control of a suspended load for crane systems in consideration of crane boom deflection. Many researches on transporting and anti-swaying control of suspended load for crane systems have been reported. However, in general, the crane boom is modeled as a rigid body. In the case that the boom length becomes longer, the amount of the boom deflection becomes larger. Also, there is a time delay in the existing mechanical system driven by hydraulic actuators. These factors cause degradation of the control stability. In the proposed system, the boom deflection as well as the time delay in the system is explicitly considered and is incorporated into the controlled plant model. The experimental results showed that the attenuation for the boom deflection and the load swaying becomes better by using the proposed method.

Abstract: Discovery of natural laws through input-output data analysis has been of considerable interest during the past decade. Various approach among which the increasingly growing body of sparsity-based algorithms have been recently proposed for the purpose of free-form system identification. There has however been limited discussion on the performance of these approaches when applied on experimental datasets. The aim of this paper is to study the capability of this technique for identifying the heat equation as the natural law of heat distribution from experimental data, obtained using a Totally-Enclosed-Fan-Cooled (TEFC) induction machine, with and without active cooling. The results confirm the usefulness of the algorithm as a method to identify the underlying natural law in a physical system in the form of a Partial Differential Equation (PDE).

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755200
Abstract: Development of a two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) virtual stiffness-damping system (VSDS) to facilitate industrial and laboratory testing of airfoil aeroelastic instability (AAT) is presented in this paper. Development and use of existing test-beds are costly due to involvement of physical springs to simulate airfoil elasticity. Although replacing physical springs with a VSDS has been used in other fields such as marine and biomechanics engineering, existing VSDSs cannot be directly used for AAT due to operation requirements and conditions being different. Therefore, in this study a new VSDS is developed specifically for AAT. Firstly, the concept of 1-DOF VSDS is extended to 2 DOFs, with the dynamics coupling between each DOF addressed at the stage of operation principle determination, by proposing direct force/torque regulation with force/torque feedback. Secondly, resolution loss in velocity measurement is identified as a main problem associated with the non-reduction transmission required and is solved by proposing a modified extended-state observer (MESO) for fast velocity estimation. Thirdly, system identification and calibration procedures involved in developing the new VSDS is reduced to minimum by applying a robust force/torque tracking controller. As validated in wind-tunnel experiments the new VSDS can closely track the desired force/torque and provide satisfactory virtual stiffness and damping in AAT.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755087
Abstract: In this paper, teleoperation control of a UR5 robotic manipulator under time-varying delay is addressed. Two control methods of joint and Cartesian space are investigated for the teleoperation system. The singularity situations of the UR5 robot are considered for the case of different degrees of freedom (DoF), and also different kinematic properties for the master and slave systems. We first focus on a Cartesian space control of a teleoperation system which is common in the literature. It is shown that this control methodology is highly prone to singular situations. To overcome this problem, a Jacobian-based control strategy in joint space is presented. An extensive simulation study demonstrates the superiority and reliability of the later control methodology.

Abstract: Position and path accuracy are among the obstacles preventing robot manipulators to be more and more used for machining applications. Nonlinear joint errors are among different sources of error in robot positioning causing flactuational imperfections to a desired trajectory of TCP. In this paper we propose a novel method to identify and reduce the fluctuations in path of robot TCP resulting from the nonlinear behavior of joint transmission systems. This method is more time efficient compared to the rest of methods present in the literature. A practical example is presented in which we have reduced the fluctuation domain from 0.15(mm) to 0.09(mm) in an industrial robot arm.

Abstract: This paper addresses the design and application controller for a small-size unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In this work, the main objective is to study the modeling and attitude controller design for a small size helicopter. Based on a non-simplified helicopter model, a new robust attitude control law, which is combined with a nonlinear control method and a model-free method, is proposed in this paper. Both wind gust and ground effect phenomena conditions are involved in this experiment and the result on a real helicopter platform demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm and robustness of its resultant controller.

Abstract: The wire tension force is an important quality criterion in a needle winding process, and has great impact on wire resistance and accuracy of wire positioning. For tension simulation within the wire track a nonlinear system model was presented in which force sub-models emulate force impacts. Special sensor technology was assembled to detect wire tension forces during the winding process. Measurement data were used to validate the simulation results. The resulting data of simulation model and measurements were fused in a Kalman-Filter to estimate wire tension. Finally, change in wire tension for varying dynamics and varying brake forces was investigated.

Abstract: In actual industrial processes, it is difficult to optimize parameters for a control system because of its perturbations. As a result, the performance of the control system may depend on a designer experience. To solve this problem, we have proposed a method to optimize the controller parameters with support vector machine. With the proposed method, we can obtain a robust controller without the need for designer's rich experience. Experimental results show that the proposed method enables us to design parameters for a robust controller in a two-wheeled inverted pendulum.

Abstract: Using a surgical robot for bone milling can reduce bone tissue damage due to the cutting process. Robotic systems can regulate bone cutting parameters at an optimized setting to reduce excessive bone milling force and temperature. This study investigates the possibility to minimize cortical bone milling force and temperature by optimizing the milling parameters. An artificial neural network (ANN) is constructed to estimate the mean milling force and bone temperature as a function of milling feed rate and spindle speed. The ANN outputs are then used as the objective functions in a genetic algorithm (GA) for optimizing two conflicting objectives, i.e. the milling force and bone temperature. The results indicate that minimizing the bone temperature requires increasing the feed rate that increases the milling force.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755133
Abstract: In this paper, the authors design a controller for a robot-trailer system to solve the path following problem. A kinematic state-space model is derived using tractor steering angle rate as system input so that undesirable effects of input disturbances can be reduced. A tracking error of the trailer position may exist when there are biases on the measurements of heading angles. An improved integral separation combined with linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is designed for the system to remove the trailer position error. The tractor relative location is used to estimate whether the system is under steady state. The controller with integral action can be difficult to tune, so a genetic algorithm (GA) is then used to find optimal LQR controller parameters. Simulation results verify the approaches above.

Abstract: Automated radio map building for Radio Signal Strength (RSS) based fingerprinting localization is implemented in this paper. Fingerprinting technique is composed of an offline phase for collecting geotagged fingerprint data called a radio map and an online phase for location estimation by comparing an unknown object's location with the radio map. Typically, radio map is created manually by moving and pin-pointing a location while scanning a network for RSS values within a pre-specified pattern. This cumbersome method is very time consuming and results in inaccuracies in the radio map. This paper presents an automated system to build a radio map of indoor environment by using a self-directed car. The car can move, measure 2D distances, collect RSS values and forward the data to a server via a gateway which calculates the car location coordinates. To test and verify the system, an experiment is conducted in our departmental office spaces. The coordinate estimation accuracy and RSS mapping consistency produced by the proposed system make it possible to build a more accurate and realistic radio map for indoor environments in an automated fashion with decreased possibility of human errors.

Abstract: This article introduces a robust adaptive control development to deal with internal uncertainties and external disturbances on Internet-based robotic teleoperation systems with time-varying delay. Modelling uncertainties are one of the critical challenges in control design procedure for robotic systems. In teleoperation applications interacting with unknown remote environment, latency of communication networks jeopardises stability and performance of the system. Adaptive algorithms are capable of guaranteeing the system's stability and performance under time-varying delay and uncertainties. Hence, based on the maximum magnitude of those disturbances, an adaptive control methodology is applied on an Internet-based teleoperation system to robustify its stability and performance. An extensive simulation study demonstrates effectiveness of the developed control technique.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8754911
Abstract: This paper proposes a new force sensing approach based on the singular spectrum analysis and the dither periodic component elimination Kalman filter to realize a wideband sensorless force control system. The dither periodic component elimination Kalman filter and the disturbance observer are integrated to configure the force sensation with the cancelation of dither signal component and noise in the force information. Moreover, the singular spectrum analysis based velocity estimation, which is the input information of the force sensation, is constructed to improve the force sensing performance and realize the wideband force control system when the pole of the disturbance observer is greatly increased. The proposed method achieves considerably widened force sensing bandwidth. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experimental results.

Abstract: A high copper fill factor allows reducing the resistive losses responsible for more than 50 % of the losses in today's most commonly used electrical motors. Single-turn windings achieve a copper fill factor close to one. Furthermore, they do not suffer from turn to turn faults and provide a low thermal resistance between winding and stator. The reduced EMF of single-turn winding configurations promotes the use of extra-low voltage high current MOSFETs. Rapid development of these MOSFETs allows reversing common design principles to explore new applications, such as battery electric traction drives. This paper presents a 2.5 V 1 kW MOSFET driven 13-phase permanent magnet DC motor with a single-turn winding configuration. The motor prototype with a copper fill factor of 0.84 was tested with continuous drive currents up to 600 A. The measured torque-efficiency map shows that such a high-current concept with voltages below 60 V is feasible using today's extremely low-voltage high current semiconductors. Due to the rapid development of such switches, there is great potential in this concept for further improvements. This work presents a small-scale version of the high-current drive, which is part of the development of an extra-low voltage traction drive concept.

Abstract: In this paper, a sensorless control for permanent magnet synchronous motors is presented. It is based on the reconstruction of the rotor speed and position using the traditional back-electromotive force (emf) method with the addition of an innovative speed observation. The observer parameters are computed according to the speed through an appropriate adaptation law that allows real time gain calculations Furthermore, the speed is calculated from the back-emf observer which induces a velocity offset due to the observation errors inherent to the emfs sinusoidal forms. To overcome this drawback, the use of the position derivative is proposed taking discontinuities into account. Simulation and experimental results validate the proposed method.

Abstract: In this paper, a general lumped parameter bearing current model is presented. The lumped parameters are derived from the analytical descriptions of the bearing current paths and the numerical field simulations based on the finite element method. The model considers frequency dependence. The resulting model delivers the common mode current and the circulating bearing current is determined by modeling the magnetic coupling between the common mode current path and the circulating bearing current path. The derived circuit can be applied to AC machines and is verified by measurements of a permanent magnet excited synchronous machine, which is supplied by an off-the-shelf motor drive inverter.

Abstract: Efficiency is one of the most important properties of an electric motor. Motor performance and testing standards have evolved to better characterise the efficiency of a motor, but are typically limited to the motor itself and describe the efficiency at a single speed. Newer standards have been developed to cover the complete motor-drive system, including variable speed drive, but exclude the efficiency of the end application. Efficiency maps can describe efficiency over the full speed-torque operating area of a motor, but significant testing effort is required. This paper describes an autonomous motor testing system that can produce efficiency maps covering the complete power drive system, including the end application device. This system level data can provide a deeper understanding of component level interactions and aid in the efficiency optimisation of combined power drive system and end application.

Abstract: A sensorless displacement estimation method for an electrostatic film motor has been proposed in the previous work. Differently from the existing built-in sensor systems proposed for the electrostatic film motors, the proposed method can estimate the slider position by directly utilizing the driving currents. Therefore, the sensing method can be realized in a simple hardware; it does not require additional hardware components. In its trade-off, the performance of the sensing method can be considerably affected by the motor structures and the operation voltage waveforms. However, the previous work only investigated the sinusoidal-voltage operation for a regular (non-skewed) motor. In this article, we investigate the performance of the sensing method in several different conditions. As the motor configurations, this article deals with two types: a regular (non-skewed) motor and a skewed motor. As the voltage waveforms, the article investigates both a sinusoidal waveform and a pulse waveform. Through numerical simulations and an experiment, the article shows the performance of the sensing method in the above conditions. It was confirmed that the proposed method can work well for the skew motor during the sinusoidal-voltage operation, at least in the ideal condition without noise. However, it was also suggested that the sensing method is more susceptible to noise in case of skewed motors. For pulse waveforms, it was shown that the method did not work well due to the large current spikes at the voltage switchings. Detailed investigation of the signals suggested that by ignoring the voltage switchings, the sensing method would work even for the pulse waveforms.

Abstract: The audible noise of electric machines has become an important criterion in their design. In this context, several studies discuss the vibration behaviour of the electric machines stator, which is the main vibration source in the electric machine. These studies are based mainly on finite element multi-physics models. The load of the mechanical model is defined by the Maxwell pressure (electromagnetic forces) applied on the inner radius surface using an electromagnetic model. And finally, the radial vibration is calculated on the outer radius surface of the stator. When it comes to the mechanical load definition, many studies neglect the tangential forces to simplify and reduce the calculation time. In this paper, validated numerical models are used to study the effect of radial and tangential forces on vibration. Comparisons are made with several machines in order to determine robust conclusions.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8754970
Abstract: This paper presents a new rotor position sensorless control method based on information of magnetic saturation for synchronous machines such as PMSMs and SynRMs. In general, magnetic saturation causes performance deterioration and an unstableness of sensorless control in the worst case, because magnetic saturation leads to the disappearance of magnetic saliency and a reversal between the estimated d- and q- axes. Furthermore, heavy magnetic saturation largely rotates saliency position in the direction of the current vector and thus destabilizes the sensorless control. The proposed method achieves stable sensorless control in extensive heavy load states by using information of magnetic saturation. In consequence, the proposed method doubles the torque range for sensorless control of the test SynRM, and achieves stable position sensorless control in all torque ranges.

Abstract: Anisotropy based encoderless control methods are using the magnetic saliency of an electrical machine in order to determine the actual rotor position and rotor speed. The saliency can either be caused by the geometry of the rotor or by local saturation appearances due to the rotors or stators permanent magnets. Stability is a known issue in the field of anisotropy based encoderless control, the authors in [1] therefore developed three criteria which have to be fulfilled by the machine. The fulfillment of the criteria guarantee, that the anisotropy based control algorithm operates stable and the machine is observable. This publication will investigate the impact of temperature on an adapted stability factor compared to the one defined in [1]. The investigation for the Interior-Permanent-Magnet-Synchronous-Machine (IPMSM) with distributed windings was done by means of finite element simulation (FEM). It will be shown that the area of stable operation is changing with temperature due to the changing properties of the motors materials.

Abstract: This paper proposes two novel predictive current control (PCC) strategies for six-phase asymmetrical permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) with single neutral (1N) configuration. The first strategy uses a new set of virtual vectors with fixed amplitude that effectively reduces the harmonic components in six-phase machines with a 1N configuration. The second strategy uses variable amplitude virtual vectors, improving the performance of the drive in steady-state operation, and imposing a fixed switching frequency. Several simulation results are presented in order to assess the performance of the six-phase PMSM drive under the proposed control strategies.

Abstract: This paper proposes a stable position sensorless control method from extremely low speed region to high speed region in high speed permanent magnet synchronous motor. One of the authors have already developed highly accurate position sensorless control in the low speed range by using an All-pass filter (APF) and a Band-pass filter (BPF). There exists a drawback, however, such that the discretization error in the high speed region deteriorates the position estimation performance since the flux estimator is constructed in the stationary frame. To solve this issue, this flux estimator using APF is constructed in the estimated rotating coordinate in this paper, realizing stable and highly accurate position sensorless drives in whole speed region except of standstill. Also, this paper experimentally shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Improvement of the energy efficiency of wind generation installations can significantly reduce their payback period, especially for small-scale wind turbines in regions where wind streams are highly unstable. Meanwhile, electric machines are still the main source of losses in such systems. The most effective Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs) substantially depend on the availability and prices of rare-earth magnets, as well as proper thermal and flux operating conditions. A good alternative in terms of efficiency and reliability for PMSM can be a Synchronous Reluctance Motor (SynRM). However, high nonlinearity of SynRM's magnetic circuits hampers the improvement of the control performance, which can be crucial not only for accuracy of torque curve MPPT tracking, but also for the efficiency of the inverter-motor systems as a whole. This paper provides a description of the offline characterization procedure for SynRM motors and comparison of main control laws in terms of inverter-motor efficiency.

Abstract: The paper discusses the optimal design procedure of an induction machine with squirrel cage under highly dynamic load conditions. A special feature in the procedure is resulted from the fact that the converter-driven induction motors with high rotor bars has significant transient skin effect due to high-dynamic torque reversals during high-dynamic load cycles. Therefore, the additional eddy current losses must be taken into account in the design and optimization procedure. Additionally, high-dynamic drives require motors with a moment of inertia as small as possible. Aiming at reducing the additional eddy current losses and the moment of inertia of drive motor simultaneously, a load cycle-based design optimization program for induction machines is developed for highly dynamic applications by using a rotating cross cutter automation as an example.

Abstract: For modeling electrical machine characteristics with a high level of detail, one of the important aspects is to represent slotting effects on the air-gap magnetic field. In analytical model approaches, the stator and rotor slots typically influence the magnetic field indirectly as part of air-gap permeance. This work provides a comparison of state-of-art methods to approximate the air-gap permeance including slotting effects. The selected methods are compared with regard to spatial distributions of radial air-gap magnetic flux density and of exemplary flux linkages for a theoretical movable coil. As calculation basis, a cage induction machine at a static operating point is considered. The resulting magnetic flux density distributions illustrate the accuracy differences between the air-gap approximation approaches. Special focus lies on variations in the curve shapes, which are connected to rather generalizable method characteristics. Regarding the exemplary flux linkages, a majority of the approaches lead to strongly resembling results. In this context, computing efficiencies of the methods constitute a discussion point.

Abstract: A novel zig-zag transformer is employed in a unified ac-dc power conversion system to integrate ac (grid) and dc (photovoltaic) sources. Winding leakage inductance of the zigzag transformer is effectively utilized as the integrated-boost inductance for PWM rectifier, thereby reducing component count and improving power density. In this paper, optimal design methodology of such a line-frequency zig-zag transformer is addressed such that required winding leakage inductance is met while optimum efficiency is achieved. An optimal pair of flux density and inter-winding isolation distance are derived employing a comprehensive mathematical framework such that the required design objectives are fulfilled. Results from analytical calculations are corroborated using finite element method (FEM) and experimental verifications. Close agreement is noticed among the results which substantiates the modeling accuracy and aptness of the proposed design methodology.

Abstract: This study paper a new compensation method for estimating temperature using a voltage disturbance observer. In motor driving systems, it is important to monitor the temperature of the motors in order to prevent demagnetization and dielectric breakdown. Generally, thermal sensors are used to obtain the temperature information. However, this increases the costs and motor volume. Hence, it has been proposed a method to estimate the temperature based on the motor model without a thermal sensor. To overcome the problems with regard to voltage disturbances, this paper proposes a new method to compensate the voltage disturbances and confirms the effectiveness through experiments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new predictive current control (PCC) strategy based on variable amplitude virtual voltage vectors for six-phase asymmetrical permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) with isolated neutrals. The proposed strategy combines the optimal virtual vector with a zero vector during a sampling period in order to regulate its effective amplitude. The analytical expression for the duty cycle of the optimal virtual vector is derived and the switching patterns used to synthesize the virtual vectors are presented.

Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid generator with a PM(Permanent Magnet) exciter to improve the operating efficiency, dynamic response and emergency starting characteristic. The proposed hybrid generator is designed by the parallel combination of the winding field and the PM field. In the proposed hybrid generator, the PM assistant field can be added to the conventional winding rotor to improve the total efficiency without the complex optimized design. The assistant PM field can supply the enough linkage flux to produce the no-load generation voltage and the starting power for the controller. The controlled field current of the winding part, is used to produce insufficient flux to keep the constant output voltage from the load variation of the generator.Furthermore, the direct field current control scheme using the PM exciter can improve the dynamic performance compare than the indirect field current control structure of the conventional excitation system. In the designed 10kW prototype hybrid generator with PM exciter is tested and compared with the conventional generator, hybrid generator with the winding exciter.

Abstract: A bidirectional three-level current-fed DC/DC converter is proposed for low voltage high current application. To reduce the peak current through high frequency (HF) transformer and switches at light load condition, a dual phase shift modulation is proposed and employed. Zero current switching of primary switches and zero voltage switching of secondary switches are achieved for a wide load range. The voltage across primary devices is naturally clamped at rather low reflected output voltage, enabling the use of low voltage rating devices. The total losses are reduced significantly and the converter performance is greatly improved. Simulation results and experimental results are presented to verify to the theoretical analysis.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the sensitivity of a class Φ2 inverter to component tolerances and PCB parasitic elements when switching at very high frequency (VHF: 30MHz-300MHz). The class Φ2 is a single transistor resonant inverter topology with low transistor voltage stress and fast transient response. Previous work has demonstrated its virtues at VHF and its use in different applications such as wireless power transfer or plasma etching. When switching at very high frequency, a small variation of component values in their tolerance range may have a significant impact on the class Φ2 inverter behavior. Additionally, at VHF, passive component values become of the same order of magnitude as PCB parasitic elements. In order to assess the sensitivity to component variations and PCB parasitic elements, a 30MHz 30W class Φ2 inverter using GS61004B from GaN Systems is designed and simulated with LTSpice. A prototype is then built in order to validate the simulation model. Once the LTSpice model verified, a Worst Case analysis is performed with component tolerances of 5%, 10% and 20% and the class Φ2 inverter behavior is recorded. Critical PCB parasitic elements are then identified, and their maximum acceptable value is determined using the Worst Case analysis.

Abstract: In most Pacific Island Countries (PICs), the populations reside in isolated communities where electricity generation is hard to access and therefore these communities are heavily dependent on fossil fuel based generation plants. One way to reduce the dependence on these fuels is to use the abundant, albeit intermittent, Renewable Energy Sources (RES). At present most RES based microgrids (MGs) use lead acid battery batteries as the only way to store energy, which can be detrimental for the environment. This paper proposes to minimize the ecological impact support them by using Flywheel Energy Storage Systems (FESS) so as to reduce the size of battery strings required or increase the storage performance of the MG. A case study on data for a small village in Taveuni (Fiji) is presented and the advantages of using a FESS as a back-up storage system are highlighted and discussed.

Abstract: Based on the requirements of power processing unit(PPU), this paper proposes a converter suitable for its wide input and wide output voltage range applications. The first stage adopts a four-switch Buck-Boost converter, which operates in two-mode state and can meet the request of wide input and wide output voltage range. At the same time, the interleaved parallel technology is used to reduce the inductor volume, so that the power density can be increased. The circuit topology of the second stage employs an LLC resonant converter. The LLC resonant converter operates in fixed frequency mode to obtain a stable voltage transfer ratio, which is similar to the DC transformer; the LLC resonant converter can achieve zero voltage turn-on of the primary side switches and zero current turn-off of the secondary side diodes, which can contribute to the increase of efficiency.

Abstract: Synchronous electrostatic harvesters are able to deliver a higher amount of power to electronic devices compared to the asynchronous electrostatic harvesters. However, synchronous generators need a control circuit for synchronising the electrical switching events with the energy source frequency. Asynchronous electrostatic generators have the advantage of omitting this control circuit resulting in a simplified implementation and eliminates the power consumption related to this part. In this paper, the performance of a typical circuit based on each structure is explored and the optimal parameters for the asynchronous circuit are presented. It is shown mathematically and verified in simulation that the maximum generated power in the asynchronous circuit is equal to 50% of the generated power in the synchronous circuit considering the conduction losses.

Abstract: In the conventional integrated reconfigurable converter (IRC) topology, the battery modules charging mode was implemented using a unidirectional DC/DC buck converter supplied by an external DC source. This paper proposes an enhanced IRC configuration which allows bidirectional energy transfer between the battery modules and the AC grid. The bidirectional energy transfer is facilitated by the IRC DC/DC converter and an H-bridge. During the `battery to grid' mode the active/reactive power control is realized by cooperation of the DC/DC converter operating in the boost mode and the H-bridge in the inverting mode. Conversely, during the `grid to battery' mode, the DC/DC converter operates in the buck mode and the H-bridge as a rectifier. The proposed configuration is compact as the same inductor can be shared between all IRC operating modes. A scaled down prototype of the IRC is implemented with three series-connected battery modules. Presented experimental results verify viability of the proposed configuration.

Abstract: Variable speed technique can improve the hydraulic power profitability and optimise the hydraulic transient process. Permanent magnet synchronous generator equipped with power electronics are widely implemented in the hydraulic context. The robust and efficient control of the DC-link voltage is important in the energy conversion process. However, the DC-link control stability is negatively affected in the presence of hydraulic power variations and various disturbances. In this paper, a Linear Extended State Observer (LESO)-based DC-link voltage controller is implemented in a variable speed hydro-electric plant. Comparative experiments with well-tuned PI controllers are conducted, the results prove its higher robustness and disturbance rejection ability under varying hydraulic conditions.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755096
Abstract: This paper proposed a single-stage soft-switching AC/DC converter without soft-switching auxiliary circuit. The proposed AC/DC converter only uses two main active switches to execute the input power factor correction and regulate the output dc voltage magnitude. Thus, the input power factor is high and the input current distortion is low on the ac input side. Moreover, the output DC voltage is stable and its ripple is low. Although the proposed AC/DC converter does not include soft-switching auxiliary circuit, the all main semiconductors can switch at soft-switching condition. Thus, the circuit topology is simple and the circuit cost is low. Furthermore, the proposed AC/DC converter does not also include front-end four-diode rectifier on the ac input side. The conduction losses can also be reduced. The proposed AC/DC converter uses a simple frequency modulation control strategy to synthesize a low harmonics sinusoidal input current waveform and achieve well dynamic regulation function. A design example of 600W single-stage soft-switching AC/DC converter is examined to assess its performance.

Abstract: In this paper, a self-excited inverter is utilized to construct the inversion stage of the wireless power transfer (WPT) system without the PWM generator and digital signal processor, which could dramatically simplify the hardware structure. Meantime, soft-switching and automatic frequency tracking could be achieved without additional strategies which also decrease the complexity in control. Generally, in a WPT system, the current of primary-sided coils is expected to be kept constant despite the variation of load, which is helpful to achieve the constant voltage (CV) or constant current (CC) output of the WPT system. Accordingly, the parallel-series (PS) resonance topology is utilized to achieve the high robustness of the primary-sided current without additional compensation networks. The analysis and design procedure for the WPT system are provided and a low-power prototype is built. The simulation and experimental results validate the design of the WPT system. When the load resistor changes from 30&#x03A9; to 10 &#x03A9;, the fluctuation of primary-sided current is only 4.3%, and a dc&#x2013;dc transfer efficiency of 85.82% with a 9-cm distance and 73.16-W output power is reached.

Abstract: A light-emitting diode (LED) driver for the automotive lamp is proposed. The power conversion circuit of the driver combines a step-down converter and a step-up converter to cope with the variation of the input voltage by interchanging the association active power switches and regulating the duty-ratios. The circuit operations for voltage step-up and step-down modes are analyzed, and then the circuit parameters are designed accordingly. A laboratory circuit is designed for a motorcycle headlamp with five LEDs in series, which is powered by a dc source with wide input and output voltage ranges. Experimental results have demonstrated that the LEDs driver can be swapped between the step-up mode and step-down mode and adjust the lamp current properly for an input voltage range from 8 V to 13.5 V with the two to five LEDs in operation. A high efficiency can be achieved in the case that the difference between the input voltage and the output voltage is small. The highest efficiency can be as high as 98.2 %.

Abstract: LC filters are widely used in power electronic systems for extracting the specific frequency band component, or absorbing harmonics. In the low-frequency harmonic filtering applications, bulky inductors and capacitors are implemented for low cutoff frequency, which contribute to high percent of volume, weight, cost, and failure rate. Recently, to exceed the limitations of the bulky inductors, a two-terminal active inductor concept has been proposed, which is implemented by power switches and energy storage elements. It has the same impedance characteristic at the frequencies of interest and has potential to replacing the bulky inductors in the LC filters. In order to explore the benefits of the new concept, this paper compares the performance of DC-link LC filters with a two-terminal active inductor and a passive inductor for a three-phase diode bridge rectifier. Benchmarking in terms of inductive energy storage, volume, and weight are compared. The electro-thermal and reliability performance of the filtering capacitors in the two filters are also investigated. Experimental results are provided to verify the accuracy of the theoretical analyses.

Abstract: CHB multilevel converters play a role for optimising the use of solar electricity as they allow a more efficient energy conversion. In this work, a classic control of a CHB multilevel inverter for PV energy injection is developed, considering grid disturbance compensation and an MPPT strategy for maximising PV energy. In order to prove the proposed control scheme, simulations in MATLAB/Simulink are carried out. The current control strategy, the dc voltage control, and the MPPT controller proved proper steady state operation and proper response in front of external disturbances. Additionally, the inclusion of a dynamic decoupler for the inverters output current control proved to be useful tool for controlling multilevel converters. Thus, solar energy injection to the grid can be maximised using the proposed 7-level CHB multilevel inverter.

Abstract: This paper introduces basic operating principles and control strategies for a three-phase series-connected asymmetric hybrid modular multilevel converter (SCAH-MMC). SCAH-MMC is a more economical choice for converter tapping application. Meanwhile, it possesses the low voltage ride-through capability. A control strategy is introduced to make sure of the balanced real power input of each phase under unbalanced fault conditions on the ac grid side. In order to suppress the third harmonics inherent in the SCAH-MMC, a proportional resonant (PR) controller is applied. By modifying the modulating signal of arms based on the PR controller, third-harmonic currents of SCAH-MMC can be significantly reduced. The proposed control strategies are validated by simulation results using PSCAD/EMTDC.

Abstract: Under the condition where power grid voltage is unbalanced and distorted, dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) is used to compensate the negative sequence voltage and harmonic voltage. In this paper, a novel double closed-loop control strategy is presented. The outer voltage loop of the controller is based on proportional multi-resonant (PMR) controller, while the inner current loop is based on proportional controller. Parameter tuning of inner current loop is investigated and the optimal gain is obtained through root locus curve. This method can maximize the stability of current loop and effectively suppress LC resonance at the same time. Simulation and experimental tests show that the proposed control strategy significantly improves the output voltage quality of DVR.

Abstract: Microgrids formed by series-connected units provide an attractive way to integrate non-dispatchable low-voltage distributed generation (DG) such as solar photovoltaic (PV) panels to utility grid or microgrid, using DC-DC conversion stages with reduced boost voltage ratios. However, adequate power sharing and voltage regulation of a microgrid containing mixed dispatchable and non-dispatchable cascaded DGs demand new control approaches to achieve operational performance and reliability comparable to the conventional parallel-topology microgrid. This paper presents a series-cascaded microgrid architecture formed by a dispatchable master DG unit followed by a set of non-dispatchable slave PV units. A fully decentralised control scheme is proposed, which achieves autonomous power balancing and voltage regulation, ensures full utilisation of non-dispatchable generation units, and allows surplus power curtailment under light load conditions. The performance of the control approach is investigated by extensive switched simulations for various operating control modes and under different load scenarios.

Abstract: This paper proposes a dc/dc converter that mainly consists of two interleaved boost converters. Both boost converters are designed to operate at discontinuous current mode (DCM). Both boost converters share one coupled inductor which consists of a magnetic core with two windings. Based on the principle of magnetic flux balance, the magnetic exciting current can be diverted between two windings of the coupled inductor. This leakage current is used to discharge the parasitic capacitors of the active switches. By this way, the active switches can be turned on at zero voltage. It helps to reduce the switching losses and hence, achieve high circuit efficiency. A 200W prototype circuit was built and tested. Based on the experimental results, both active switches are operated at ZVS. The circuit efficiency is 90%. The satisfactory performance has verified the feasibility of the proposed circuit.

Abstract: As implementation of IoT, mobile and wireless devices emerged rapidly. Innovation of RF-DC conversion system would be important to extend the operating life time of those devices. However, most of the proposed CMOS rectifiers have low power conversion efficiency which is limited by high threshold voltage drop. Beside, most of these rectifiers are low sensitivity which could only receive input power at high level only. This paper presents a high efficiency 5 stages cross coupled-rectifier design in 130nm CMOS technology. The rectifier is used for RF to DC conversion operating at -20dBm at 2.45GHz. The cross-coupled rectifier topology eliminates the threshold voltage of the rectifier to 50% as compared to the conventional rectifier. A supporting circuit has been constructed so that the rectifier can be matched to a 50Ω RF port. Simulation result shows that the rectifier achieved 68.26% of power conversion efficiency (PCE) at input power of -20dBm. The output voltage and output current that could be generated by the rectifier is 1.742V and 1.34μA.

Abstract: On-state voltage is predominantly used in the health monitoring of the IGBT. In this paper, fast, accurate and online on-state voltage measurement circuit is suggested for an IGBT. The circuit is capable of measuring positive on-state collector-emitter voltage (VCE-ON) and negative forward voltage (VF) of anti-parallel diode. The measurement circuit offers the scaling/shifting of the on-state voltage, which facilitates direct connection of Analog to Digital (ADC), to monitor the voltage in digital controllers. The key advantage of the suggested circuit is that the overall measurement error is about ± 0.111%, which is below the allowable error limits (± 0.33%) for condition monitoring of the IGBT. A flexible voltage clamping is provided, during OFF state of device, to minimize the error in the measurement. Different possible errors in the measurement are due to, i) resistor mismatch, ii) diode voltages mismatch, and iii) ADC quantisation and opamp. The detailed analysis of the mentioned errors is presented in this paper. Simulation and experimental validation of suggested circuit is carried out and results are also compared with previously reported measurement circuits.

Abstract: This paper presents an analysis for the experimental set up of a double toroid variable inductor (VI) that is fed by a DC-DC converter. The main objective is to analyze the behaviour of the VI for different power levels, in particular the influence of the control circuit to regulate the inductance of the main winding. By observing the waveform of the main current winding, it is possible to demonstrate the ability to increase or decrease the inductance value. A variable inductor is typically used from linear to saturated state and presents an inversely proportional inductance as a function of the main winding current. By employing this current-controlled double toroid VI it is possible to have both an inductance increase and inductance decrease as a function of the control current by regulating the reluctance of the magnetic cores.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755015
Abstract: The existing international standards define grid harmonic limitations only up to the 40th or 50th harmonic. Increasing trend of grid-tied inverters in renewable energy systems causes grid distortions beyond the existing harmonic standardization range leading to low power quality, consumer load damage and excess power loss in the power network. Hence, this paper investigates the influencing factors towards these harmonic emissions of grid-tied inverter systems. Controllers for the inverters are designed for rated operation condition assuming the DC-link voltage and grid voltage is ideal, even though these systems mostly operate at partial powers and distorted DC-link and grid voltage conditions in practice. Hence, this paper presents an analysis of grid current distortion when the inverter operates with fluctuating DC-link voltage, different power levels and controller gains of the proportional resonant controller. The results show high gains of the controller, partial power operation and low frequency fluctuations of DC-link voltage cause increase in harmonics up to 2 kHz while there is no significant effect for 2-9 kHz harmonics. Further, the study demonstrates the significance of grid current distortion when grid voltage is distorted at the frequency where output impedance of inverter together with grid impedance is minimum. This analysis is presented for both stiff and weak grid conditions since the grid distortion varies with different grids.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755173
Abstract: A novel topology of high step-up ratio DC-DC boost converter for multiple outputs is developed in this paper. Based on the conventional boost converter topology, this new design consists of an LC filter in the input side, a coupled-inductor for high output voltage, a transformer and other auxiliary components for multiple outputs. This design can achieve high output voltage at the main-load of the circuit and, meanwhile, achieve high output voltage at each secondary part of the transformer. Each secondary part of the transformer acts as a "small voltage source" and the voltage of them can be adjusted by both the duty cycle and the corresponding turn ratio of the transformer. The "multiple" means both the number of the secondary part and the output voltage value of each part are variable. This will be extremely important in the industrial utility and domestic uses since this converter can power multiple loads with only one input source. In this paper, the proposed converter topology will be introduced with mathematical analysis and simulation results to illustrate the potential value of it.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755219
Abstract: In this paper, a novel interleaved high step-up DC-DC converter with three-winding coupled inductors and voltage multiplier cells is proposed for renewable energy systems. The voltage-lift and voltage-stack methods are used to extend the voltage conversion ratio. The converter achieves high voltage gain without operating at extreme duty ratio. The voltage stress on the power switches is greatly lower than the output voltage. As a result, the low-voltage-rated MOSFETs with low conducting resistances can be employed to reduce the conduction losses. The diodes reverse-recovery problem can be alleviated by the leakage inductances of the coupled inductors. The input current ripple is reduced by the interleaved operation. The leakage energy of the coupled inductors is recycled such that the switch turn-off voltage spikes are avoided. The operating principles and performance analysis of the proposed converter are presented in detail. Finally, a 1000 W experimental prototype with 28 V input and 380 V output is built and tested. The experimental result are provided to validate the theoretical analysis and effectiveness of the proposed converter.

Abstract: Power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) is an attractive real-time test and validation technique for large power systems. It can be used instead of full simulation or experimental systems to reduce cost and risk, and improve testing flexibility. A key challenge is achieving a power interface with as much transparency as possible via interface algorithms, power amplifiers, and measurement and control strategies. Voltage source converters (VSCs) are a suitable amplifier option for high power applications due to their relative efficiency, but they restrict the bandwidth and update speed of the power signal reproduced for the Item-under-Test (IuT). The stability and accuracy of the PHIL system are consequently affected by these additional dynamics. This paper evaluates the stability and accuracy of a Damping Impedance Model (DIM) based PHIL system where a VSC power interface is controlled by a linear voltage controller. It will be shown that the stability and accuracy can be improved with the use of a controller, when compared to the simple open loop modulation strategy often used in PHIL applications.

Abstract: Two novel designs of DC-DC boost converters, one using cascaded structure and one with low duty cycle are presented in this paper. Each of them consists two boosting cells with only one switch to control the on-off state of the circuit. The main advantage of these two designs is providing high step-up output ratio. This is significantly useful for renewable energy system with low output voltage, such as solar energy systems, to boost its output voltage to higher ones for grid-connected equipment. One design works under low duty cycle (less than 36%). The operational modes are designed in continuous-current mode (CCM) and this can simplify the analysis and understanding of the converter circuit. In this paper, the theoretical analysis and simulation results will verify the potential value of two designs and the designed parameters will be listed for further research.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755174
Abstract: Usually a battery is used as the energy storage device in typical standalone solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. It is charged by a solar charge controller. The charging efficiency of the system depends on the efficiency of the DC-DC converter of solar charge controller. However, a considerable amount of usable energy is wasted during the charging process. In this work, a method is proposed to utilize this wasted energy and thereby to enhance the charging efficiency. In the case of an empty capacitor being charged by an external source, it stores only half of the energy delivered by the source as compared to that of an electrochemical battery. Therefore, it wastes 50% of useful energy. A portion of this wasted energy can be collected and utilized if a useful resistive load is connected in series to this capacitor charging loop. In this study, a DC-DC converter and battery bank is connected as the useful resistive load in the capacitor charging loop. A supercapacitor (SC) bank is used replacing the conventional capacitor. Therefore, total energy loss in capacitor charging loop can be minimized by storing energy in both battery bank and SC bank. This concept is introduced into a typical PV system for reducing its energy losses. Experimental results show an enhancement in charging efficiency when this new method is employed. The energy stored in the SC bank could be used for driving loads with required electronics.

Abstract: The distribution of drinking water in cities demands a large amount of electricity. Much of this energy is wasted by the natural effects of friction inside the pipes. Other very important losses are due to the transport of water to high reservoirs, generally located in hills near homes. In many cases the pressure that reaches the homes is sufficient to meet the needs of the house and requires the use of a regulating valve to prevent damage to the seals of the accessories inside the house. In the present work, the development of an experimental model for the measurement and utilization of at least a part of the extra potential energy applied to the water when carrying it to the elevated reservoir is shown. An electric hydro generator is used and the energy generated is stored in a battery for marginal use in the home. This contributes to a saving of money and contributes to the reduction of the impact of the ecological footprint.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8754950
Abstract: One of the key challenges in an islanded microgrid is fundamental and harmonic power sharing by the inverters in proportion to their ratings. Emulating virtual impedance much larger than the line impedance at the output of the inverters ensures proportional sharing of harmonic currents at the cost of increase in voltage harmonic distortion. This may violate the voltage harmonic limits specified by IEEE 519 standard. These limits are even more stringent when the loads are highly voltage sensitive. A novel method is proposed in this work to ensure proportional harmonic current sharing while maintaining the harmonic voltage distortion within the limit. Increase in harmonics in the output voltage due to high virtual impedance is estimated and compensated. A low bandwidth communication (LBC) is used to compensate the harmonic voltage which utilizes only two bits per harmonic frequency. A detailed simulation study is done in MATLAB-Simulink to validate the proposed technique.

Abstract: The modeling and implementation of a 9-level switched-capacitor (SC) boost DC-AC inverter is presented by combining an active-harmonic-elimination (AHE) controller for realizing a staircase inversion and closed-loop regulation. In this 9-level SC inverter, there are three pumping capacitors and bidirectional switches used between supply VS and output Vout in order to obtain the maximum gain of 4 as well as the inverted gain of 4 at most. For achieving a staircase AC output, these bidirectional switches are driven by the clock generator so as to boost/invert Vout into 1x, 2x, 3x, or 4x voltage of VS. Here, the AHE technique is employed not only to manipulate the time durations of the output levels of 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x for the elimination of the 3rd, 5th, 7th harmonics, but also to enhance the regulation capability for the different desired output. Further, the relevant modeling and some theoretical analysis are included. The performance of this inverter is simulated and verified experimentally on the implemented prototype circuit to show the efficacy of this scheme.

Abstract: The steady state performance of the dual active bridge converter has been widely researched before. This paper focuses on the modulation strategy for optimized transient performance of the dual active bridge converter under reverse of the power flow direction. Firstly, normal modulation methods to reverse the power flow direction are presented. The transition time under the normal methods is relatively long and it can cause a DC component in the high frequency inductor current, which can compromise the normal operation of the high frequency transformer. To overcome the drawbacks, this paper presents a novel strategy to modulate the dual active bridge converter during the reverse of the power flow direction. The transition gets faster and the DC component in the inductor current is eliminated based on the proposed modulation strategy.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8754988
Abstract: Most energy-efficient appliances internally operate on DC, with the potential to be powered by a DC source. Supercapacitor Assisted LED (SCALED) converter is one of the new circuit topologies under development for low voltage LED systems where a supercapacitor (SC) bank is used instead of a battery bank to buffer for fluctuations of the renewable energy source. The technique is fundamentally based on the notion of circumventing the resistive losses in a RC charging loop, coupled with the useful property of commercial 12 V LED luminaires that they operate as constant-power devices within a wide range of DC voltages applied to the lamp.When an energy-consuming LED luminaire acts as the resistive part of the RC charging loop of the SCALED approach, the voltage across the luminiare does remain constant. However, by careful measurement of the LED lamp behavior, it was identified that most 12 V commercial products work well within the topological limitations of the SCALED technique, with approximately constant brightness. The paper presents how these practical properties of low-voltage LED lamps could be effectively used in SCALED technique, which is useful in DC microgrid applications.

Abstract: Power converters are essential for allowing increasingly more solar energy to be connected to power systems. In this paper, a model predictive control of a three-phase 7-level CHB multilevel inverter for solar energy injection is developed, using the incremental conductance algorithm for establishing an MPPT strategy which maximises PV energy from the system. In order to prove the proposed control scheme, simulations in MATLAB/Simulink are carried out. The predictive current control strategy, the dc voltage control, and the MPPT controller proved proper steady state operation and proper response in front of external disturbances. Thus, solar energy injection to the grid can be maximised using the proposed 7-level CHB multilevel inverter.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method to effectively suppress the resonance by reshaping the output impedance of doubly-fed induction generator(DFIG). Firstly, the impedance model of a typical DFIG system is established, and the mechanism of parallel resonance in DFIG system and its influencing factors are studied. Then, with the goal of effectively suppressing high-frequency resonance, this paper seeks the optimum values of the virtual resistances added to the stator branch and the grid-side converter(GSC) branch, uses the notch filter to implement the impedance reshaping of only harmonics, and optimizes the GSC and rotor-side converter(RSC) control strategies. Finally, using PSCAD, the effectiveness of this resonance suppression strategy is verified.

Abstract: This paper extends previous work on the Sequential Phase-Shifted Model Predictive Control (SPS-MPC) strategy into a Single-Phase Five-Level Flying Capacitor Converter (SP-FL-FCC). The use of SPS-MPC in an FL-FCC is not as straightforward as it first seems. Therefore, a sequential average model based on more than one active control input is derived. The proposed SPS-MPC strategy achieves a fixed switching frequency, which is beneficial regarding of semiconductor loss distribution, and also to ensure that a high-bandwidth is achieved that compares favorably to the finite-control-set MPC case. Simulation results of the proposed SPS-MPC strategy validate the current and FC voltages tracking control during the transient and steady-state conditions at a fixed switching frequency.

Abstract: Simple bidirectional power line communication (PLC) method by using switching ripples in DC-DC converters is proposed. In this method, current ripples in the input side of converters are used as signal carrier whose frequency is modified as a function of transmission data. The frequency modulator is easily realized by just adding a transistor and a resistor to a conventional PWM controller. Demodulator is also realized by simple analog circuit. With proposed method, the converters are capable of data transmission through DC power lines. Bidirectional communication is also achieved under certain conditions. Both computer simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of proposed method.

Abstract: The dual active bridge (DAB) converter has been widely applied in energy storage systems because of the high-power density, galvanic isolation and soft switching properties. However, the interaction between the DAB converter and its LC input filter may cause unstable problems. To address this stability issue, the full-order impedance model of the DAB converter is firstly developed based on generalized state-space averaging method. The developed impedance model can be used to accurately predict the stability of the DAB converter with its LC input filter. Based on the developed model, the effects of the LC filter on the system stability are revealed. Furthermore, the stability-oriented filter design guideline is provided. The optimized filter parameters can improve the stability of the system. Finally, the impedance model and stability analysis are validated by the comprehensive simulation and experimental results.

Abstract: This paper presents extended loss analysis and thermal characterization of the alternate arm converter (AAC) based on detailed semiconductor models. Due to the uniqueness in structure and operation of the AAC topology compared to other modular topologies in the family of modular multilevel voltage source converters, extensive thermal analysis is important to evaluate its performance, reliability, and life-time for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) applications. This paper accommodates preliminary results of thermal modeling, losses, and thermal stresses of the AAC for a range of operating cases including lower modulation indexes, different power factors and voltage sags. Results based on a benchmark AAC-HVDC model verify the AAC thermal model and demonstrate the necessity of detailed thermal modeling across diverse operating cases for comprehensive evaluation of thermal stresses in design stages.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8754914
Abstract: Doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) connected to DC microgrid is different from that connected to AC power grid. It is not necessary to limit the frequency of power generation to fundamental frequency. In order to improve the efficiency of power generation, we can broaden frequency range of DFIG and always make it operate at super-synchronous state within a certain range of wind speed. The topology of DFIG-DC system in this paper is to connect an uncontrolled rectifier on the stator winding and a small capacity full-controlled converter on the rotor side of DFIG. Double closed loop control method is adopted to control frequency with magnetic linkage and realize the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) with stator power. By means of the vector control, a smaller constant slip is maintained so that the rotating speed of stator magnetic field is somewhat less than the rotor speed to reduce the cost of rotor side converter (RSC). The simulation results show that the constant slip control strategy can be used in the wide frequency operation of the DFIG-DC system.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8754959
Abstract: This paper develops and solves a new probabilistic economic load dispatch approach (PELD) for a power system, which includes combined heat and power (CHP) generation, heat-only, thermal, wind and photovoltaic units. Given the crucial role of load demand in power system operation, load uncertainties are taken into consideration and modeled using the two point estimation method (2PEM). The proposed PELD problem is solved using a hybrid imperialist competitive algorithm based on Nelder Mead approach (HICA- NM). Its performance was assessed using a modified 40-units power system incorporating several wind, photovoltaic and CHP units and subject to load and operational demand. The obtained results confirmed approach's ability to yield optimal solutions in uncertain environments, thus enabling better management of modern power systems.

Abstract: Uncertain generation by renewable sources and load variations have resulted in adding energy storage systems in the grid to maintain grid parameters (voltage, frequency) within prescribed limits. The disturbances being non-deterministic in nature, the voltage regulation control by the storage systems relies mostly on dual loop architecture with an outer voltage and inner current loop. Improvement in controller dynamics can be achieved through feed forward of disturbance profile but at expense of additional sensors and communication in the grid. This work explores the application of an adaptive disturbance rejection control scheme for disturbance estimation (without using additional sensors) employing an extended state and proportional integral observer (PI+ESO). The proposed observer aim to achieve robust disturbance estimation under grid parameter uncertainty. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme over the conventional one will be put forward through H∞ and H2 norm analysis of the system. The design and simulation results of the proposed scheme will be presented in this work.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to evaluate the distribution system reliability including weather dependency of component failure rate (FR) and restoration time (RT) while an efficient Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method is used. The effects of different weather conditions such as high winds, lightning can be incorporated in the reliability evaluation by considering their impacts on FT and RT. MLMC method is a recently developed variance reduction technique for Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) which is proposed for reducing reliability indices computation time. Application of the MLMC method is carried out on a well-known test distribution system. The effects of the normal and adverse weather conditions on reliability estimation are determined. The results are compared with those obtained by using MCS.

Abstract: Energy cooperatives (ECs) such as residential and industrial microgrids have the potential to mitigate increasing fluctuations in renewable electricity generation, but only if their joint response is coordinated. However, the coordination and control of independently operated flexible resources (e.g., storage, demand response) imposes critical challenges arising from the heterogeneity of the resources, conflict of interests, and impact on the grid. Correspondingly, overcoming these challenges with a general and fair yet efficient exchange mechanism that coordinates these distributed resources will accommodate renewable fluctuations on a local level, thereby supporting the energy transition. In this paper, we introduce such an exchange mechanism. It incorporates a payment structure that encourages prosumers to participate in the exchange by increasing their utility above baseline alternatives. The allocation from the proposed mechanism increases the system efficiency (utilitarian social welfare) and distributes profits more fairly (measured by Nash social welfare) than individual flexibility activation. A case study analyzing the mechanism performance and resulting payments in numerical experiments over real demand and generation profiles of the Pecan Street dataset elucidates the efficacy to promote cooperation between co-located flexibilities in residential cooperatives through local exchange.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755216
Abstract: This paper investigates the changing nature of frequency stability problem in wind-rich power systems. The published studies on frequency stability with wind power generation have mainly used simple power system models and frequency nadir as the metric. This approach is not sufficient to characterise the impact on frequency stability with wind power generation. In this study, active power vs. frequency response characteristics is used to evaluate the frequency stability of a large power system. A systematic methodology is followed to investigate the frequency stability with high wind power generation based on the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) technology. Therefore, steady-state system parameters, such as active and reactive power generation and terminal voltages are maintained constant when integrating DFIG wind farms into the network. The results show that the integration of DFIGs with inertia and active power controls has two significant positive effects in the frequency arresting period. Firstly, with the DFIG wind generation, power system can regulate frequency in the fast-transient period of the frequency regulation dynamics which was not possible with the synchronous generator. Secondly, the total deceleration torque of the system has decreased due to the fast and the improved response of DFIGs which ultimately leads to improved frequency stability as it reduces the maximum frequency drop. Therefore, integrating DFIG wind farms with appropriate controls would improve power system frequency stability.

Abstract: As new energy with high permeability is connected to the distribution network through power electronic equipment, the droop control in the past can no longer meet the needs of coordinated control of wind power, photovoltaic and other distributed equipment in the AC-DC hybrid distribution network. Therefore, this paper proposes a decentralized coordinated control strategy based on dynamic multi-agent to improve the traditional droop control. Firstly, the distributed controller in AC-DC hybrid distribution network is regarded as an agent, and the frequency deviation of each distributed device can be obtained through the communication and interaction of multiple agents. Then, the reference value of DC voltage in the droop controller is improved to support the system frequency. In addition, by adjusting the active power instruction of dynamic multi-agent, the power distribution of distributed controllers is realized. At last, a typical model of the medium and low voltage AC-DC distribution network is built in the PSCAD/EMTDC software to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, compared with the traditional droop control.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EV) and the increasingly important role of active distribution grid in modern power systems, the cooperative optimization of power dispatching between power system and electric vehicles has become absolutely necessary. In this paper, a distributed algorithm aimed at optimizing the dispatch of power systems containing EV stations is proposed. When compared with the traditional centralized algorithms, the proposed algorithm proves to be more suitable for the distributed topology of the modern power system. On this basis, a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) price model for EV stations matching this algorithm is set up, and can be used to guide EV stations to schedule their output more accurately. To eliminate the possible line congestions in the optimization process, a dynamic constraint set method is adopted to adjust the obtained optimization results. A 15-node test system with a distributed topology is used to verify the applicability of the proposed framework.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755243
Abstract: This paper aims to evaluate the economic performance of a grid-connected system with storage under a dynamic electricity pricing environment with time-of-use (TOU) and feed-in electricity tariffs. The storage can assist in the demand side management as well as to reduce the electricity bill of the consumers. In this case, consumers would purchase electricity during off-peak pricing periods to charge the batteries, and during peak pricing periods, the energy stored would be used to supply the demand or sold back to the grid. Therefore, the two objectives are to minimize the cost of energy drawn from the utility, while maximizing the energy injected under the Time-of-Use and Feed-in-Tariff schemes. Thereafter, the performance of the developed model to maximize the proposed grid-interactive system's economic profitability is analysed through a case study which is simulated using Matlab. Simulation results show that a potential of 52% energy cost saving can be achieved using the proposed system rather than supplying the load demand by the grid exclusively.

Abstract: This paper presents novel method for design of Fractional-order Automatic Voltage Regulator (FoAVR) and Fractional-order Power System Stabilizer (FoPSS). As complexity of power system is increasing drastically and one of major problem is low frequency oscillation that adversely affect stability of the power system hence the use of PSS to damp-out power system oscillations is of practical importance. The objective of designing PSS is to provide additional damping torque without affecting the synchronous torque at critical oscillation frequencies. This paper discusses the effectiveness of the designed PSS and AVR as fractional-order lead-lag compensator to damp the oscillations of Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) power system. It is shown using MATLAB Simulink studies that the proposed FoAVR and FoPSS shows better performance than integer order lead lag compensator.

Abstract: Power system equipment modeling is a key-activity in the electric industry. The modeling capacity allows electrical engineers to comprehend the system behavior and to predict possible problems, affecting power system planning, operation and design. Also, the differences between equipment models and system responses urge to be minimized, avoiding engineers to believe that the power system is more robust than it really is. Among all equipment, the synchronous generators play a central role in the modeling process, because they are the predominant form of generation and their dynamic behavior affects almost all aspects of power system operation. Recently, the oscillographic systems have been upgraded, providing more monitored quantities with better precision. Although several works present studies using phasor measurement data, there is a lack of discussion of model calibration using disturbance data generated by oscillographic recorders. In this context, this paper intends to contribute with a synthesis of the experience of the Itaipu power plant in using oscillographic data in model calibration, presented as a set of guidelines highlighting practices that can help engineers to evaluate generator models.

Abstract: Small governor deadbands on synchronous generators assist in maintaining power system stability by facilitating a fast primary control action. However, Australia's fleet of synchronous machines currently employ large governor deadband settings which has coincided with a deterioration in frequency control, threatening system security and reliability. An augmented 14-generator east Australian model is developed and used in a case study examining the effect on power system stability with a range of governor deadband settings and the impact of market operation on frequency control. The reintroduction of tight governor control is recommended to restore fast primary control action (hence system stability) which cannot be achieved using market principles.

Abstract: Increasing price of fossil fuels and public awareness encouraged many countries to use clean technologies in transport and electricity generation sector. The advent of smart meters can identify unbalance in PV-EV distribution grid which is a great concern for Distribution Service Operators (DSOs). Several researchers have accessed the degree of unbalance and impact of unbalance on distribution grids considering either distributed PV or EVs. Moreover, a few research work has been done for mitigating unbalance till now. This paper measures unbalance due to unequal distribution of loads and sources among three phases and assess the impact of unbalance on power quality of the PV-EV distribution system by considering different PV and EV penetration levels using DigSILENT Power Factory simulation software. An improved method is proposed to mitigate unbalance using Genetic Algorithm by optimizing load distribution among phases. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated considering unequally distributed residential and EV load scenarios, and it is found that the proposed method can reduce a significant amount of unbalance at all the buses of the distribution grid.

Abstract: The presence of electrical energy storage (EES) units in distribution systems has potentials to improve the network profiles (e.g. bus voltage and branch current profiles) as well as to reduce operational cost and power losses. This paper presents a novel approach to determine the optimal charging/discharging schedule of EES units in distribution systems by employing multi-objective optimization methods, aiming at reducing operation cost and enhancing radial distribution networks security. In this regard, a voltage stability index (VSI) to improve the radial network security is presented as a separate objective function.

Abstract: Due to integration of large amount of renewable energy generators (REGs) to the power grid, implementation of reactive power support mechanisms as well as their optimal placement and operation are becoming a real challenge for the transmission/distribution system operators. Besides, because of the stochastic nature of renewable energy generation, reactive power planning and optimization in renewable rich power grids are an arduous task. In this paper, an optimal reactive power dispatch problem is formulated incorporating the reactive power support from the renewable energy generators. Two coordinated optimization algorithms (particle swarm optimization and pattern search algorithm) are combined to enhance the optimization performance. Finally, the IEEE 39 New England test bus system is modified and used to perform the optimization.

Abstract: In order to generate adequate electricity energy, conventional power plants utilize dramatic volume of water resources. Different methods such as replacing cutting-edge technologies of facilities have been proposed to diminish water consumption in this industry. Most of the approaches are considered as medium or long-term solution which requires substantial investment costs. Meanwhile, because of the process and technology, natural gas-fired power plants need less water among conventional power plants. Therefore, shifting unit commitment planning toward these power plants would aid to save water consumption. Nevertheless, overlooking combined cycle power plants can perform negative impact on power plant efficiency, and it may increase power generation cost. This paper aims to investigate multi-objective optimization problem to minimize water consumption by maximizing the power generation efficiency. Hence, this method contemplates economic dispatch by selecting more efficient and less water required power plants. The proposed model is examined on an IEEE 24-bus test system to address the results, and it is compared with the conventional economic dispatch problem to clarify the impact of the proposed approach. According to the results, some relevant conclusions are drawn.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755090
Abstract: The rapid development of smart grids signifies that accurate prediction of photovoltaic (PV) power generation allows efficient load demand scheduling and reduces the impact of uncertainty for power dispatch. The PV power output, however, is not easy to accurately predict because of its intermittent and random characteristics. Parameters such as the generated photocurrent, the reverse saturation current, the series resistance, the shunt resistance and the diode ideality dominate the power output of solar cells. These parameters have a nonlinear relationship with power output and can vary when the PV cells age. To improve this problem, this paper first uses Matlab/Simulink to establish the PV power generation model using a single-diode circuit. A multi-agent algorithm that uses an enhanced charged system search (ECSS) is then used to estimate the optimal parameters and to predict the PV power output. The proposed method is tested on a 32kWp PV power generation system. To verify that the proposed method is optimal, the results are compared with those for the traditional differential evolution (DE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods.

Abstract: In this paper, a photovoltaic system connected to the grid with the capability of providing ancillary service of harmonic compensation based on the instantaneous power theory is studied. For this, the control strategy uses the inverter, that interfaces the PV with the grid, to operate injecting the power from the PV and additionally functioning as an active power filter. One of the advantages of the proposed strategy is that the compensation is performed without the need of detection of the harmonic components present in the current and a phase locked loop, which reduces the computational effort. Other advantages of this method are a simple algorithm, good dynamic response and a low number of sensors. For implementation the measured grid power is used as control variable. The control is based on the power balance between the grid and the inverter, and is carried out in αβ coordinated system. A perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm is used for maximum power tracking, along with a control algorithm for dc bus voltage. To validate the study, results were obtained in three different scenarios.

Abstract: Due to the technological advances of wind energy utilization and conversion systems, power generation based on wind energy has long since been recognized as one of the most promising solutions to contribute to a more sustainable energy supply. The increasing phase-out of fossil fuel based conventional power plants leads to new challenges on how to operate future power grids. To support research efforts towards meeting the upcoming challenges a new laboratory will be founded with the main objective of establishing novel and innovative investigation opportunities for application-oriented wind energy research and close cooperation with industry and academia. The infrastructure will include a laboratory-scale modularly reconfigurable wind farm and feature high-performance control systems for accurate real-time emulation of aerodynamics as well as wind farm energy management.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755128
Abstract: By bidding strategically, a producer firm owning several generators aims to maximize its profit by submitting optimum bids to the wholesale electricity markets. For a bulk power producer that influences the price of electricity, i.e. a price-maker producer, strategic bidding problem appears as a highly non-convex and challenging optimization problem. The computation time of state-of-art solution method for strategic bidding problem increases linearly as the number of random scenarios or scheduling horizon increases. However the computation time of state-of-art approach increases significantly as the size of power grid increases. This paper proposes a partitioning method that when combined by the state-of-art solution method results in considerable reduction in computation time.

Abstract: DC faults originate uncertainty in the progression of multi-terminal high voltage dc (MTDC). The fault current makes a rapid, sharp peak, but isolation of the entire network is not a viable solution under a specific fault circumstance. Rapid detection of a fault with high accuracy is essential for the reliability of the entire network. This paper proposes a fault detection scheme to sieve voltage harmonics from system voltage by using Discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Voltage harmonics rapidly employed the fault detection at the converter stations for MTDC networks without communication. The proposed scheme is also capable of classifying internal and external fault by counting the 12th harmonic pulse count. The simulations are executed in PSCAD for four terminal MTDC transmission network to vindicate the performance of the proposed scheme. Comprehensive analysis of test results verified that the proposed scheme, in addition to rapid and precise fault detection, can also efficiently classify the nature of faults. Moreover, consequences proved its promising performance for numerous MTDC faults.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8754976
Abstract: This work proposes an optimal wind farm layout framework to obtain the optimal placement of wind turbines in a wind farm. The optimization objective is to minimize the average cost per net electric power generated by a wind farm with a fixed number of turbines while the distance between turbines is no less than the allowed minimal distance in the far wake region. The wind farm micro-siting problem with Frandsen's Gaussian wake model based on the conservation of momentum is formulated as a constrained optimization problem and solved by real-coded Genetic Algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the Frandsen's Gaussain wake model is more consistent with real wakes and thus the optimization result is more accurate than the existing practices.

Abstract: The measurement of the rotational speed and angle of a rotating shaft is one of the most frequently used measurement in all fields of mechanical engineering. Different sensing principles, such as optical or magnetic, are commonly used. However, magnetic based sensors offer highest robustness to harsh and dirty environments and are therefore the preferred solution in automotive applications. Even if magnetic based speed sensors exist since decades, their performance is continuously improved and adjusted to the different applications. The paper introduces the sensing arrangement for speed measurement of a rotating shaft. The state of the art magnetic sensing technologies, which are Hall, AMR (anisotropic magnetic resistance), GMR (giant magnetic resistance) and TMR (tunneling magnetic resistance), are described and their limitations are shown. In addition, the recently developed high-linearity-TMR is introduced. The key parameters of the evaluated sensing technologies are compared to each other. The result shows that the recently developed high-linearity-TMR (tunneling magnetic resistance) sensing technology offers the best overall performance.

Abstract: The paper presents experimental validations of noise power in system under hardware constraints. A system performance is limited by the noises penetrates into the system and the noises power highly depends on hardware configuration. Therefore, appropriate hardware configuration is important to realizes a required specification with minimizing hardware resources. Then, to validate the noise power in the existing hardware setup is significant for the control design. In the control system, a noise power density has relation to an expression of power of numbers and the sampling time of the controller, namely a spatiotemporal resolution. The paper firstly derives a theoretical relation between the noise power and the spatiotemporal resolution and then validates the theory by experiments. The experimental validations show the practical perspective for the controller design and indicates a design guideline of the hardware configuration.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755143
Abstract: A force control for contact with flexible objects using a reflected-wave rejection technique is presented in this paper. To satisfy the demands of precise and rapid control including contacts with flexible objects, force controls for a multi-mass resonant systems are required. Generally, force gains are set high in force control to achieve high compliance. However, high compliance by a high force gain leads to degradations of positional stabilities. Thus in order to attain adaptability to the environment while decreasing the positional fluctuation, environmental dynamics have to be controlled. Furthermore, to increase the operation speed, excitations of high order resonances should be suppressed. In this context, this paper considers the environmental dynamics as an infinite-mass and proposes an integrated controller design using a reflected wave rejection technique. In addition, a notch filter is integrated to compensate for the propagation delay of the reaction force. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed through simulations.

Abstract: It is well known that Kalman Filter is good for a state estimation on a linear system. The criterion is a square error function, which is efficient and sufficient for most systems. However, the square error evaluation function is often not sufficient in the systems under non-Gaussian noise. In recent years, an entropy has been attracting attention as an evaluation function changing to the square error criterion. Beginning with entropy of Shannon, its characteristics are related to higher-order statistics. When the entropy is set as criterion, all moments or all even moments of the state estimation error can be constrained. These characteristics have been utilized for learning system, adaptive filtering, and neuro-control. In this research, we focus on a correntropy, which has expanded Renyi 's entropy more generally, and the correntropy is utilized in order to estimate states of systems. This method uses multi-step ahead predictions, and aims to better state estimation. The method of multi-step ahead predictions is effective for the case that the system has not only statistic process noise but also other disturbances. Previous methods using the correntropy as a criterion are introduced here, and compared with modified method through experimental data.

Abstract: Motion-copying system (MCS) is one of the effective method for saving and reproducing the human motion. By using MCS, we can choose the appropriate data depending on the various situation and reproduce by using robot. In MCS, the performance of motion reproduction is important. However, in real industrial apprication, vibration is caused by mechanical resonances. Then, performance of motion reproduction is degraded. To avoid the performance degradation, we propose motion reproduction method considering vibration suppression. By using proposed method, precise motion reproduction using flexible structure is achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulations.

Abstract: Measurement and control of rapid optical processes usually require pulsed lasers or fast-response instruments, which are too expensive or complicated for use in industries. A motor-driven polygon mirror can deflect an optical beam so that it passes across a distance of 1 mm in 5 ns, i.e., a sweep velocity of 190 km/s. This time-space conversion realizes rapid modulation of a continuous-wave beam and observation of nano-second phenomena. This article reports some experimental results that were attained by the use of this sweep method.

Abstract: Reliable completion of the computing jobs through Amazon spot instances (SIs) with proper bargaining is challenging. Therefore, an SI bidding system is developed for deadline constrained jobs considering both the conditions of the market and the condition of the user. The system tries to bargain with the provider by bidding low when the task is not urgent. After that, the system increases the price or the price distribution gradually when the progress is lower than required. To calculate the bid distribution, we compute the probability density of the price after five minutes. Then, we apply our developed equations to compute bid-prices from the probability density function. Equations are easily interpretable to both humans and machines. We also consider long-term probability distributions of the prices for the reliable completion of the job. Tasks with several days deadline are prescribed to bid considering the daily price-curve. According to the evaluation of Amazon SI price, the proposed system effectively saves 79%-87% for jobs with several hours deadline and saves 82%-100% for jobs with several days deadline compared to the on-demand instances. Moreover, our algorithm helps all bidders by keeping the price low.

Abstract: The detection of software clones is gaining more attention due to the advantages it can bring to software maintenance. Clone detection helps in code optimization (code present in multiple locations can be updated and optimized once), bug detection (discovering bugs that are copied to various locations in the code), and analysis of re-used code in software systems. There are several approaches to detect clones at the code level, but existing methods do not address the issue of clone detection in the PLC-based IEC 61131-3 languages. In this paper, we present a novel approach to detect clones in PLC-based IEC 61131-3 software using semantic-based analysis. For the semantic analysis, we use I/O based dependency analysis to detect PLC program clones. Our approach is a semantic-based technique to identify clones, making it feasible even for large code bases. Further, experiments indicate that the proposed method is successful in identifying software clones.

This necessitates improving the performance of the cyber-communication internetwork; this performance improvement includes optimization of network techniques as well as the security of the cyber-network. Internet infrastructure has been upgraded to higher level ever than before, where we are enjoying technologies like fibre, 10-gig ethernet and even 100-gig ethernet, but there is no guarantee of communication in the cyber space, internet still providing packet delivery on "best effort" basis. On the other side, cyber hackers are targeting big physical infrastructures, industrial hardware in addition to the financial institutions. Therefore, it has become vital to address secure and faster data communications, in order to improve the Performance of the Internetwork.

Abstract: In Industry 4.0, systems with a heterogeneous implementation, different architecture, protocols, and semantics have to be integrated into collaborative environments. The interoperability between them has become a major challenge in this new ecosystem of the industry, thereby generating several research questions about how to manage the information exchange and collaboration between systems with so vastly different properties.This paper presents a detailed investigation of the different mismatch problems that can happen in the information exchange in heterogeneous SOA-based environments where the interoperability is crucial. The proposed solution in this paper is an Adapter System that can aid generatation of new service consumer interfaces at both compile-time and run-time. The interfaces are based on Service Contracts, thereby allowing heterogeneous systems to communicate and interchange services.The proposed approach requires a new point of view in the service description field that can provide a holistic description of the information required for creating both run-time and compile-time consumer interfaces.

Abstract: Cloud computing and big data have risen to become the most popular technologies of the modern world. Apparently, the reason behind their immense popularity is their wide range of applicability as far as the areas of interest are concerned. Education and research remain one of the most obvious and befitting application areas. This research paper introduces a big data analytics tool, PABED (Project - Analyzing Big Education Data), for the education sector that makes use of cloud-based technologies. This tool is implemented using Google BigQuery and R programming language and allows comparison of undergraduate enrollment data for different academic years. Although, there are many proposed applications of big data in education, there is a lack of tools that can actualize the concept into practice. PABED is an effort in this direction. The implementation and testing details of the project have been described in this paper. This tool validates the use of cloud computing and big data technologies in education and shall head start development of more sophisticated educational intelligence tools.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cardiovascular condition. It often leads to a heart attack causing millions of deaths worldwide. Its accurate prediction using data mining techniques could reduce treatment risks and costs and save million lives. Motivated by these, this study proposes a framework for developing parsimonious models for CAD detection. A novel feature selection method called weight by Support Vector Machine is first applied to identify most informative features for model development. Then two evolutionary-based models called genetic programming expression (GEP) and genetic algorithm-emotional neural network (GA-ENN) are implemented for CAD prediction. Obtained results indicate that the GEP models outperform GA-ENN models and achieve the state of the art accuracy of 90%. Such a precise model could be used as an assistive tool for medical diagnosis as well as training purposes.

Abstract: Metal-based 3D-printing is nowadays particularly applied by branches with special needs concerning weight and strength as well as complexity of geometries of metal parts (e.g. aeronautics, automotive), or in case of needs with respect to logistics of metal spare parts (e.g. defense). The broader community of manufacturing enterprises still struggles with a holistic economic decision-making that covers aspects of geometry, supply-chain management, future maintenances, or the production volume over a product's lifetime. This paper introduces a concept of a recommender system that supports the decision-making during product design and manufacturing process design in order to validate economics of the involvement of 3D-printing for creating single components or parts of the designed product.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge of interest in using IoT systems for an increasingly diverse set of applications, with use cases ranging from medicine to mining. Due to the disparate needs of these applications, vendors are adopting a growing number of messaging protocols, encodings and semantics, which result in poor interoperability unless systems are explicitly designed to work together. Key efforts, such as Industry 4.0, put heavy emphasis on being able to compose arbitrary IoT systems to create emergent applications, which makes mitigating this barrier to interoperability a significant objective. In this paper, we present a theoretical method for translating message payloads in transit between endpoints, complementing previous work on protocol translation. The method involves representing and analyzing encoding syntaxes with the aim of identifying the concrete translations that can be performed without risk of syntactic data loss. While the method does not facilitate translation between all possible encodings or semantics, we believe that it could be extended to enable such translation.

Abstract: Unit Manufacturing Processes (UMP) are models that capture succinct definitions of individual manufacturing steps in a manufacturing system. They are used to facilitate model composition and reuse. However, mainly due to their textual nature, they are difficult to use in conjunction with other types of computational models and in subsequent analysis activities such as optimization. This paper describes our method that allows UMP models (conforming to the ASTM E3012 standard) to be combined with other types of manufacturing system models (such as analytical, data-driven, and simulation models). This is done through an interface between a tool used to create UMP models (in the ASTM E3012 standard) and an analytical framework for the composition and analysis of manufacturing process models. Additionally, we present an example showing how the combination of the two tools can be used in practice.

Abstract: In IoT (Internet of Things) applications, security issues are increasingly attracting attention. However, current embedded processors lack cryptographic protection mechanism. In this paper, an austere RISC-V core processor with RV32I subset instruction is deemed as a master device to cooperate with an AES cryptographic engine in an SoC, due to its openness and flexibility. This core contains separate instructions and a data bus connected to a Wishbone crossbar. A Spartan-6 XC6SLX9 board is taken as an architecture protocol verification platform, where the peak operating frequency of the RISC-V core and the encryption SoC is 105MHz and 111.5MHz, respectively. The hardware resource utilization is reduced compared with the MIPS core with identical efforts.

Abstract: In this paper, a Silicon On Thin Buried-oxide (SOTB) implementation of the 32-bit floating-point Twiddle Factor (TF) is presented. The architecture was developed based on the adaptive COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC). The CORDIC method is a well-known approach for approximating the complex-number multiplication, also known as TF in Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) designs. The SOTB-65nm TF core layout has the size area of 86.7K-μm2. The measurement results showed that at the best crossing-point of the 0.75-V power supply (VDD), the chip could run at the maximum operating frequency (FMax) of 32-MHz and consumed 181-μW power. At the sleep-mode, the leakage power dropped about 258.6× to 0.7-μW at the 0.75-V VDD.

Abstract: A new method for classifying cardiac abnormalities is here proposed based on the electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG may manifest abnormal heart patterns, which are generally known as arrhythmias. MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and AAMI standards are used for machine learning purposes considering the patient-oriented scheme. Heartbeat time intervals and morphological features processed by a 2-D time-frequency wavelet transform of ECG signals are combined into an image, which carries relevant information from each heartbeat. These dataset images are used as input to train and evaluate the classifier, which is essentially a 6 layers convolutional neural network (CNN), resulting in powerful artifact discrimination. The training set is artificially augmented to reduce the imbalance of the five heartbeat classes, achieving better results. A significant achieved overall accuracy of 95.3% of the proposed method, compared to some of the most relevant published methods, permits to expect effective results when applied to real patients.

Abstract: Periodic fractographic analysis of fracture surfaces helps improve performance of mechanical pieces and avoids economical and security problems in many industries, such as the automotive industry. Classifying a fracture into a failure mode is necessary to determine the causes that generated the fracture in the first place. Experts in fracture classification of metallic materials usually use texture and surface marks to determine the type of fracture. Deep Learning is a machine learning technique that learns features directly from input data and has achieved outstanding results in object classification. However, when it comes to texture classification, the results of deep learning are not as good as in other classification tasks. This paper proposes to improve the performance of deep learning for texture analysis in the context of fractographic classification by extracting handcrafted features (Haralick, fractal dimension and local binary patterns) from the output of the convolutional layers of the VGG-19 model. Four datasets are used in this paper. Two common textural databases, KTH-TIPS and KTH-TIPS2-B, are used as benchmark for the texture recognition problem, and two datasets of fractures are used for evaluation of the proposed methods. One of the datasets for evaluation corresponds to real-scale images of ductile, brittle and fatigue fractures; and the other dataset corresponds to images acquired with a Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of ductile, brittle, fatigue and corrosion fatigue fractures. The best performance for the KTH-TIPS and KTH-TIPS2-B datasets was attained with local binary patterns (LBP) extracted from the first feature map of the third convolutional layer with an F1-score of 1.0 and from the second feature map of the fifth convolutional layer group with an F1-score of 0.77, respectively. In the case of the fracture database of real-scale images, the best performance was attained with fractal dimension features extracted from the feature maps of the first convolutional layer with an F1-score of 0.72, and with LBP extracted from the first feature maps of the fourth convolutional layer for the SEM images.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to use a webcam to instantly track the region of interest (ROI), namely, the hand region, in the image range and identify hand gestures for home appliance control (in order to create smart homes) or human-computer interaction fields. Firstly, we use skin color detection and morphology to remove unnecessary background information from the image, and then use background subtraction to detect the ROI. Next, to avoid background influences on objects or noise affecting the ROI, we use the kernelized correlation filters (KCF) algorithm to track the detected ROI. The image size of the ROI is then resized to 100x120 and then entered into the deep convolutional neural network (CNN), in order to identify multiple hand gestures. Two deep CNN architectures are developed in this study that are modified from AlexNet and VGGNet, respectively. Then, the above process of tracking and recognition is repeated to achieve an instant effect, and the system's execution continues until the hand leaves the camera range. Finally, the training data set can reach a recognition rate of 99.90%, and the test data set has a recognition rate of 95.61%, which represents the feasibility of the practical application.

Abstract: Increasing the road safety requires monitoring drivers' behaviour and evaluating their awareness. Low awareness related crashes have significantly increased in recent years due to the augmentation of social media and driver assistance systems. Accordingly, an advanced system is required to monitor the driver's behaviour and generate warning alarms if driver's performance degradation is detected. This study aims at evaluating the vehicle and driver's data to determine the performance of drivers the onset of degradation. Physiological signals such as perinasal and palm electrodermal activities, heart rate and breathing rate are measured during the simulated driving. Measurements are coming from healthy subjects (male/female and elderly/young). The lane deviation of the vehicle is treated as the response variable whether driver is impacted by stressor or not. Measured physiological signals are then processed and applied for developing machine learning tool for driver's performance evaluation. A mix of linear and non-linear classification algorithms is used for this purpose. Prediction results indicate that the random forest algorithm outperforms other methods by achieving an area under the curve of 0.92%. Its performance remains quite stable and consistent in multiple simulations. Also, it is shown that perinasal perspiration is the most informative feature.

Abstract: Imitation learning has gained huge popularity due to its promises in different fields such as robotics and autonomous systems. A great deal of past research work in the field of imitation learning has been devoted to developing efficient and effective policies using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The performance of CNN-based control policies intimately depends on the network architecture. Determination of the optimal architecture for CNNs is still a hot research topic for the deep learning community. This study comprehensively investigates and quantifies the impact of CNN architecture on the performance of learned policy for an autonomous vehicle. CNN models with different architectures (number of layers and filters) are fed by visual information from multiple cameras obtained from multiple driving simulations. These networks are trained to precisely find the mapping between visual information and the steering angle. Two ensemble approaches are also introduced to further improve the overall accuracy of steering angle estimations. Obtained results indicate that deeper networks show a better performance than less deep networks during autonomous driving. Also it is observed that best results are achieved by ensemble approaches.

Abstract: Counterfeit drugs have been a serious problem causing damage to people's health over the world. Numerous anti-counterfeiting methods based on tagging have been proposed; however, they suffer from three major issues: (1) tagging is applicable only to packages, not tablets directly; (2) end-users, i.e., patients, cannot inspect the tags; (3) tagging incurs extra costs for manufacturers. This paper describes a new method that we propose for authenticating individual medicine tablets as-is by matching images of printed characters. The printed characters on individual tablets of the same medicine seem the same to human eyes, but each is characterized by tiny unique differences. The contributions of this paper are: (a) to reveal the uniqueness of the characters printed by an actual pharmaceutical-use machine and (b) to propose a practical system to identify individual tablets using image matching. Our system is useful for any patients who want to authenticate a medicine tablet at hand: it only requires a picture with a smartphone camera. Our system is also useful for medicine manufacturers, because the database can be constructed using the existing manufacturing process without incurring additional cost. Our image matching algorithm recognizes very detailed features of the images and is accurate and fast even for a large-scale database. In conducted experiments, 1,000 sample tablets were captured using the same optical setup as an actual medicine manufacturing machine. Obtained results showed that 100% accuracy in individual tablet authentication was achieved.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755180
Abstract: Having achieved satisfying performance in multiple areas, multi-task learning (MTL) is being applied on facial attribute classification. However, most multi-task learning algorithms neglect the latent connections among facial attributes, sorting attributes based on local information only, or merely viewing each attribute as independent. The concept of curriculum learning suggests that in multi-task learning, "easy" tasks can be learned first and used to guide the learning process of "hard" tasks. Inspired, we propose KT-MTL, a novel MTL network with knowledge transfer for facial attribute classification. Depending only on label information, attributes are divided into multiple tasks by spectral clustering and labeled as "strong" or "weak" embodying their correlation extent. During training, parameters learned in "strong" network are transferred to "weak" net, imitating the teacher-student learning process. Both parts contribute to the total loss with a specifically designed loss function. The proposed network archives a competitive overall accuracy score of above 92% on aligned CelebA images and the highest accuracy of 91.89% on "weak" tasks.

Abstract: The convolutional neural network (CNN) is a promising algorithm for artificial intelligence. Although it was developed for image classification, much research is currently in progress in various fields, such as object detection and image processing. The basic principle of the CNN, especially for classification, is to adopt a loss function and minimize it in an iterative way. In this paper, a multigradient-based training algorithm is proposed for image classification. The proposed algorithm defines an object function based on multigradients and trains the CNN by maximizing the corresponding objective function. When applied to open access databases, the proposed algorithm performed better than conventional back-propagation based CNN methods.

We consider both of the curve-fitting and historical similarities to compute the probability density of the SI price. Traditional SI bidding systems compute the bid price as a single value. That single value may not be suitable for all bidders. Different bidders have different urgency and preferences. The probability density of price may help users setting a bid-price considering both the urgency of the task and the condition of the market.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755125
Abstract: In visual tracking, the aspect ratio variation of a target frequently appears and accurate scale estimation is challenging. Most tracking methods employ an exhaustive scale search to estimate the target sizes. Due to expensive computation, these methods can only search for finite and discrete scales. They fail if scale varies out of range. We propose a Regressive Scale Estimation (RSE) tracking framework by integrating a positioning model and bounding box regression, for position and scale estimation respectively. We generalize the original single-channel bounding box regression to multi-channel situations, to allow for better employment of multi-channel features. Contrary to most approaches, our method directly searches the target sizes within continuous scale space, which can predict any scale, not limited by a manually specified number of scales. Our scale model regresses the height and width of target simultaneously rather than treating them as one proportional scaling factor, leading to better flexibility. Experiments on Visual-Object-Tracking 2017 (VOT) benchmarks prove that our approach can adapt the target scale and achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and robustness.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755092
Abstract: The paper focus on statistical analysis of separate, combined and partial hybridization performance of evolutionary algorithm and neighborhood searcher with a goal to find an intelligent way of hybridization of evolutionary algorithms. On the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) we measured the influence of hybridization a 2-opt heuristic-based local searcher into the evolutionary algorithm. Evolutionary Algorithm gives a diversification, while 2-opt improves intensification. The TSP is nowadays already solved for small instances rather efficiently by exact algorithms (e.g concorde) and by local search heuristics as LKH by Helsgaun. Nevertheless, the paper shows statistical analysis that intelligently hybridized algorithm combines good qualities from the both applied components and outperforms each individual method and suggest what level and type of hybridization is best for a given problem to make them intelligent. In tests we applied hybridization at various percentages (level) of evolutionary algorithm iterations. The main contribution of the paper is to show statistical analysis of hybridized evolutionary algorithms. For that purpose we used well known statistical tools. Since the evaluation scores were not normally distributed, the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis Test (KWT) was used instead of the standard one-way ANOVA. The differences were considered to be statistically significant in cases where the estimated p-values of statistical tests were less than or equal to 0.05. The analysis with KWT showed that there exist statistically significant differences in place of hybridization. The analysis revealed significant differences in all levels of the hybridization. However, intensifying the level of hybridization further increased the p-value of the KWT, which means that the place of hybridization becomes of a less importance when the level of hybridization increases.

Abstract: The formation of current stereo matching algorithms based on the guided image filtering starts from the minimization of an energy function. We extend this approach by introducing weights to the function such that contribution of different pixels can be assigned individually. This scheme is integrated with the so-called permeability filter for the weighting factors. As the whole picture is involved in the computation, no decision for the window size is required. Extensive experimental comparisons with several state-of-the-art methods using the Middlebury Stereo Evaluation version 3 datasets show that the proposed scheme has a great advantage in stereo matching.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755222
Abstract: In order to assist recognition of driver, it is effective for driver to teach recognition objects in a visual way. However, it is expected that too much information is provided for a driver from the system and it cause him distraction. Therefore, information presentation without exaggeration and without omission is demanded for assistant system. In this paper, it is assumed that the objects which contribute to driver's braking operation should be presented to him. However, these objects changes according to the facing driving situation. Therefore, a selection method of these objects in the appeared objects on driving environment based on a statistical driving behavior model is proposed in this paper. In this method, a driving behavior model is generated, which is consisted of objects detection model with deep neural network structure and time series correlation model between the appeared objects and braking operation with probabilistic model structure. The probability of contributing to braking operation for all appeared objects in driving environment is calculated based on the driving behavior model, and the objects with the high probability are selected as the object which contributes to braking operation.In the experiment, the selection and presentation accuracy of the object which contributes to braking operation was examined. As the results, it was confirmed that the appropriate object can be selected by using the proposed method, and this method has an effect of reducing false or unnecessary presentation information.

Estimation techniques have mainly utilized linear models or neural network based approaches with a focus on short term time dependencies. This paper, introduces a system model that incorporates temporal convolutions with both long term and short term time dependencies. The proposed network learns salient features and complex temporal variations in sensor values, and predicts the RUL. A data augmentation method is used for increased accuracy. The proposed method is compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms on publicly available datasets. It demonstrates promising results, with superior results for datasets obtained from complex environments.

Abstract: This paper presents application of multi-attribute decision making applied in a large public institution, to make strategic choice about new mobility technology. Electrical vehicles are becoming important parts of all vehicles product portfolios. Based on their advantages, many users are making transitions and replacing internal combustion engine vehicles with electrical vehicles. Considering a large number of vehicles, with various features, which are currently available on the market, and specific users' requirements, it is often required to apply a comprehensive decision making model in order to select the best solution. In the project presented here, decision making process and methodology used by the Institution, is highlighted. Final decision is based on the knowledge of the previous solution, already executed by one organization with similar operational requirements, and on inputs from internal departments which placed their preferences on various features of several models of electrical vehicles.

Abstract: A large number of simulation experiments were required for specialized practices. Currently, those experiments are operated in laboratories with real existed experimental equipment. However, this method render disadvantages in safety concern, economic concern and convenience concern. We proposes a method for realizing a industrial simulation system based on the Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology and the Functional Mock-Up Unit (FMU), which can be applied to many industrial fields. To verify this method, we have a thorough study on the visualization approach for airflow ventilation system, and then studied various user interacts in airflow ventilation system using Three-Dimensional Interaction Technology. In the last, we propose a method for information exchange between FMU and simulation system to realize the real time simulation of airflow ventilation system.

Abstract: This paper presents an application of supervisory control theory (SCT) of discrete event systems to the formal design of a controller for a didactic manufacturing cell. The local modular approach is used to synthesise the supervisors, and the obtained solution is translated to ladder diagram (LD) language. The methodology utilises a strategy to counter the choice problem and presents an approach to counter the avalanche effect, which are well-known challenges when converting SCT results into a PLC application program.

Abstract: This paper presents an interval algebra that can be used to create an analytic description of a smart factory. Such a description (recently termed a `digital twin' of the factory) is used to evaluate alternative manufacturing configurations as part of a search-based optimisation process. Several extensions are proposed to the interval algebra for specifying smart factory production line details. A number of real-life manufacturing scenarios are described, related to Wire-cut Electrical Discharge Machining.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755136
Abstract: The long range wide area network (LoRaWAN) forms a star topology where end device (ED) sends data to network server (NS) through gateway (GW). It requires a GW to be connected to the NS through an IP network as the backhaul link. However, when a LoRaWAN is deployed in a remote area, such connection may not be possible. Thus, it is important that the GW can reach the NS through multihop GW-to-GW (G2G) communication using LoRa technology. To realize it, we propose a multihop G2G communication protocol for LoRa networks. The proposed protocol includes both routing protocol and channel access scheme. A packet aggregation feature is also added for improving the transmission efficiency of GW. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol successfully enables multihop G2G communication for LoRa networks with reasonably good performance.

Abstract: Ethernet-based protocols are getting more and more important for Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things. In this paper, we compare the features, package overhead, and performance of some of the most important protocols in this area. First, we present a general feature comparison of OPC UA, ROS, DDS, and MQTT, followed by a more detailed wire protocol evaluation, which gives an overview over the protocol overhead for establishing a connection and sending data. In the performance tests we evaluate open-source implementations of these protocols by measuring the round trip time of messages in different system states: idle, high CPU load, and high network load. The performance analysis concludes with a test measuring the round trip time for 500 nodes on the same host.

Abstract: The Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSNs) have been exploited in various industrial applications in order to improve the productivity and reduce the cost. Recently, today's diverse industrial fields such as manufacturing, automotive and logistics demand the cooperation of both the static nodes and mobile nodes in order to foster better efficient industrial environment. However, the existing industrial wireless sensor networks standards have been focused on the network where consist of the static nodes only. Thus, the performance of the current standards would be reduced in the environments with mobile nodes. The movement of the mobile node causes the network changes and a path related to the mobile node would be disconnected until the network adapts to the changes. This phenomenon leads to loss of the data and the command, finally, it brings about a critical problem in the industrial environment where requires high-reliability and high-exactitude. To solve the problem, we propose the routing graph construction for minimizing of the network changes from the mobile nodes. The proposed method constructs the graph by distinguishing between the static node and the mobile node. To construct the graph, a skeleton graph constructed consists of the static nodes, and the mobile nodes are grafted on the graph. This is achieved that minimizing the effect of the network change and reduce the number of the disconnected path. The proposed method could be adapted to the various standards which exploit the graph for the routing. In this paper, we adapt the proposed method to the WirelessHART standard. Through the simulation result, we verify that the proposed method would reduce the damage of the network changes from the mobile node rather than the current WirelessHART standard.

Abstract: Model checking has been successfully used for detailed formal verification of instrumentation and control (I&C) systems, as long as the focus has been on the application logic, alone. In safety-critical applications, fault tolerance is also an important aspect, but introducing I&C hardware failure modes to the formal models comes at a significant computational cost. Previous attempts have led to state space explosion, and prohibitively long processing times. In this paper, we present a method for adding hardware component failures and communication delays into I&C application logic models for the NuSMV symbolic model checker. Based on a case study built around a semi-fictitious, four-redundant nuclear power plant protection system, we demonstrate how even detailed system designs can be verified, if the focus is kept on single failure tolerance.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755166
Abstract: In this paper, a fault diagnosis method for grid-connected photovoltaic (GCPV) systems is presented. The method is based on the monitoring of the ac electrical variables and especially on the measurements of the currents and voltages at the output of the inverter. After a short introduction on the topic, the necessary steps to build a GCPV system model are described; the photovoltaic (PV) array is connected to the grid through a boost converter and an inverter. Four categories of faults were studied: a) faults inside the PV array, b) faults between the dc bus and the ground, c) faults in the power electronics devices and d) faults in the grid. The response of the system to each fault case was then observed, leading to the generation of a set of symptoms and the creation of the fault signature table. Using this fault signature table, a fault diagnosis method was developed. This latter is able to detect all the studied faults and localize sixteen out of the total of twenty fault cases; two groups of faults and fourteen individual fault cases. Finally, it creates an alarm signal in less than 60 ms, assuming that only one fault is occurring at a time. The robustness of the method was validated for different irradiance levels by simulation means.

Abstract: As the core part of aircraft, the engine's health condition is tightly related to the safety of the aircraft. Therefore, to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of the engine accurately has a great practical significance. Since the turbine engine is a complex system and its life degradation process is affected by many factors, it's hard to use a certain model to represent the engine degradation. Fortunately, the turbine engine often sets a variety of sensors to obtain operational data, which provides an effective way to monitor the trend of degradation. In this paper, a prognostic approach based on least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) is proposed to estimate the turbine engine RUL using sensor data. Firstly, the health indicator (HI), which is a synthesis indicator from multivariate sensor data, is calculated using descending dimension method, then the degradation models are built through regressing the HIs based on LS-SVM. Finally, the RUL of the testing engines can be calculated by the degradation models. As an application case, the turbofan engine degradation simulation data set supplied by NASA Ames is used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Modern computing networks that enable distributed computing are comprised of a wide range of heterogeneous devices with different levels of resources, which are interconnected by different networking technologies and communication protocols. This integration, together with the state of the art technologies, has brought into play new uncertainties, associated with physical world and the cyber space. In heterogeneous networked control systems environments, awareness and resilience are two important properties that these systems should bear and comply with. In this work the problem of resilience enhancement in heterogeneous networked control systems is addressed based on a distributed middleware, which is propped up on a hierarchical multi-agent framework, where each of the constituent agents is devoted to a specific task. The proposed architecture takes into account physical and cyber vulnerabilities and ensures state and context awareness, and a minimum level of acceptable operational performance, in response to physical and cyber disturbances. Experiments on a IPv6-based test-bed proved the relevance and benefits offered by the proposed architecture.

Abstract: To increase the reliability of induction motor (IM), several techniques have been proposed in condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Bearings are the most sensitive part of IM, and fault occurring must be considered. In industry, scratch seems the most frequently occurring fault in bearing, and only few researches have encountered this issue. This paper is motivated by considering hole and scratch as faulty factor. A fast Fourier transform analysis is carried out, the features are extracted and used for training the diagnostic algorithm. Two types of diagnosis methods are proposed; machine learning algorithm and artificial intelligence method (AI). Among the various machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is selected because of its superiority over the data preprocessing. Deep Learning Algorithm (DL) is selected in case of AI because of its intrinsic property over feature learning. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is originally used for fault characterization. The advantage of both the diagnosis methods and the possibility in detecting the minor bearing faults are discussed. Finally, effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated based on the experimental and diagnosis results.

Abstract: By analyzing multivariate data collected from complex industrial processes via data-driven techniques, potential process faults can be accurately detected and isolated in a timely manner; this is essential for ensuring safety, availability, and reliability of them. In this paper, we apply the fault isolation (FI) method via classification and regression tree based variable ranking (proposed by Yu et al. [12]) to Tennessee Eastman (TE) benchmark process; TE process has been widely used in academic fields of fault detection and isolation. The purpose of this paper is to verify the performance of the FI method through TE benchmark process. As described in experimental results, the method can isolate faulty variables more clearly than comparison methods without fault smearing.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755002
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to adjust the maintenance interval of equipment by modifying the bandit algorithm. Some facilities and equipment (assembling apparatuses, generators, elevators, etc.) require maintenance or replacement to prevent failure or similar problems. Extending the interval between maintenance of the equipment increases the risk of failure but lowers maintenance costs. Our goal is to set the maintenance interval that minimizes the total cost, which is the sum of maintenance costs and the cost to fix failures. To obtain the maintenance interval that minimizes total cost, a process of trial and error is required to gather data, using an interval longer than the current interval. We consider this problem as a special bandit problem and propose a method that applies the bandit algorithm. Specifically, we regard the problem of adjusting the maintenance interval as a bandit problem with an inclusive relation in which one can know the cost of both the selected interval and also the costs of shorter intervals. As a result, the proposed method can utilize all available cost information and automatically calculate a proper maintenance interval after only a small number of trials. We perform numerical experiments with virtual scenarios and real equipment conditions and show that this method can reduce the total cost of the equipment.

Abstract: Multi-stage production systems concede for low error and failure margins within every single machining and assembly step to not degrade product quality. Especially during multi-stage production of rotating parts, minor defects during a single step can corrupt a workpiece beyond repair. Since multistage production systems are complex, inter-connected chains of machining steps, a global approach to handling and compensating error emergence and propagation is for reaching Zero-Defect Manufacturing indispensable. We introduce Part Variation Modeling within a knowledge capturing platform to monitor centrally gathered metrological data for deviations. Further, a parametric model is presented allowing for description of rotating parts and enabling identification of deviations at every stage. Based on our inter-stage correlation analysis technique, the parametric model enables description of Part Variation Modes of a piece given current machine states and historic deviation likelihood as will be presented.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755003
Abstract: A single phase grid connected solar Photovoltaic (PV) inverter requires capacitor banks as an energy buffer at a dc-link. The capacitor bank consists of Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors (AECs), which are prone to early failure due to various electrical and environmental stresses. Most of the existing literature focuses on reliability evaluation of single capacitor at the dc-link of PV inverter rather than a capacitor bank. The current paper uses a Physics-of-Failure (PoF) based approach to evaluate the lifetime of capacitor banks with different series/parallel combination of capacitors. The terminal capacitance of these banks is kept close to the desired capacitance. From the analytical and simulation studies, it is identified that the reliability of the bank increases with increase in the number of capacitors in a capacitor bank. These findings are validated on an experimental prototype of a single phase grid connected solar PV inverter.

Abstract: Normally, the slaughtering process in the poultry industry always uses chlorine solution to reduce pathogenic bacteria. However, use of chlorine in the food industry has some adverse effects, such as cross-contamination, low-efficiency sterilization, and other human health concerns because of which the industry tries to avoid usage of chlorine and other chemical substances in the production line. Currently, plasma technology is being broadly investigated to be employed for bacteria inactivation as a substitute technique for chlorine solution processing. One category of plasma technology, called plasma-activated water (PAW), has shown promising results as regards bacterial inactivation without using the chemical substance. Thus, PAW could be considered as a clean technology which has been widely applied in medical, agricultural, and food industries. This study applied PAW from arc liquid discharge in combination with ultrasound to inactivate Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus on fresh raw chicken meat. The results show that the combined technique can reduce E. coli and S. aureus in 4 mm muscle chicken thickness by 1.51 log10 CFU/ml and 0.85 log10 CFU/ml, respectively, while individual treatment with ultrasound can reduce E. coli and S. aureus by only 0.25 log10 CFU/ml. At the same time, it was found that plasma-activated water alone could reduce E. coli and S. aureus by 0.74 log10 CFU/ml and 0.68 log10 CFU/ml, respectively. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of PAW, including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), oxidation reduction potential (ORP), OH radical, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), were also investigated.

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a key concern in industrial control environments. However, industrial network security professionals require a specialized set of skills that is distinct from those in traditional IT security roles. There is currently a gap in the education sector, as very few institutions are offering training that is specifically targetted at this market. This is partially due to the fact that it has not been totally clear exactly what skills are required, and how the training must differ from traditional training in network security. In order to address this situation, we conducted an industry survey where practicing professionals could directly report the skills and aptitudes required for students in industrial network security. In this paper, we present the results of this survey. We also analyze the results and propose a new curriculum for industrial network security that meets the needs of the industry, to be delivered as a 2-year program in a technical school environment. Challenges and directions for the future are discussed.

Abstract: Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control systems are a fundamental building block of classical and modern control systems. They have been used in the majority of industrial applications from chemical process control, mechanical process control, electro-mechanical process control, aerospace systems control to electrical drive control and power converter control. Understanding these control systems and having the capability to design and implementing them are paramount to an engineer. This paper presents the development and outcomes of a new teaching PID control in a university laboratory, which provides a hands-on learning experience with a low cost thermal rig for design and implementation of the control systems. The class had 180 undergraduate and postgraduate students who came from the fields of electrical, electronic, communication, mechanical, and aerospace engineering. The teaching outcomes demonstrate improved student capability in using knowledge from theories/lectures to create a real hardware-based control system. Student feedback about laboratory activities was very positive which is strong evidence for improving teaching and learning quality.

Abstract: This article presents the findings of the integration of project-based learning (PBL) into the control system laboratory course, offered to senior level undergraduates in electrical engineering. Due to many limitations of the traditional laboratory teaching approach, the students could not apply the control techniques to real-world applications. To encourage these senior students to become active learners, effective engineering communicators, and to possess the problem solving skill in the field of control system technology amenable to the manufacturing sector, the PBL has been integrated into this course. Specifically, the assignment of constructing a physical demo, or so-called the mini-project with the programmable logic controller (PLC) was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the PBL. The mini-project was established as an open-ended task. Students were allowed to propose their ideas for creating the prototypes, i.e., the minimal viable products (MVPs). The PBL assignment was evaluated against a pre-defined scoring rubric. This new course structure has been applied for two semesters in the academic year of 2017. The students' grades, and the assessment of rubrics' criteria of the mini-project were used to compare with the students' grades in the 2016 academic year (with a traditional learning approach). It was found that the students' grades based on the new course scheme in academic year 2017 were better than those in the 2016 academic year, and the rubric's criteria assessment also showed encouraging results. This suggests the potential application of the PBL to other courses in the engineering curriculum.

Abstract: Student motivations are affected by many factors that are classified as intrinsic or/and extrinsic. This will influence students' engagement and consequently impacting their performance. To build a better judgment on the factors that affect student motivation, a comprehensive study should be applied in order to identify all factors and their drivers and how they influence student's motivation. Some of these factors have negative impact on motivation, while other have positive impact. In this paper, a multifactor based motivation has been assessed to distinguish the positive from negative factors. Then controlling student's motivation to enhance student engagement can be done through controlling these factors. The negative factors would be minimized or eliminated, and the positive factors will be encouraged and improved. Teaching institutions, universities and teachers play essential role in controlling these factors toward better motivation. A recommendation has been given to control the motivation factors that would lead to better student's engagement and performance.

Abstract: We propose a method to intuitively give the target traveling route for the snow removal autonomous mobile robot. That is, the user moves with RTK-GNSS of one frequency, and the user registers its trajectory using the smartphone, thereby setting the trajectory as the target traveling route of the mobile robot. The most important issue in this method is to reduce the error of position information obtained from the floating-point solution of RTK-GNSS obtained in the environment surrounded by the building. To solve the problem, we propose a method to correct the position of a user with RTK-GNSS only once by using the laser range sensor installed in the robot when the user starts route generation. In this paper, we describe the proposed system and method and show its effectiveness through experimental results.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755202
Abstract: The conventional Z-source inverter (ZSI) has the following disadvantages: unidirectional power flow, high start-up inrush current, presence of abnormal working state, and low boost factor. To solve the aforementioned problems, a high boost bi-directional series ZSI with novel switched inductor cells is proposed. The proposed novel switched inductor (SL) cell replaces three diodes in conventional switched inductor (SL) cell of the series ZSI with two capacitors and one active switch, thus allowing bi-directional power flow. Besides, the Z-source diode is also replaced by a full controlled switch. The simulation and experimental results indicate that the proposed boost ZSI has the following merits: high boost factor, soft-start capability, bidirectional power flow capability, and elimination of abnormal working mode under low power factor condition.

Abstract: In this paper, the three-level (3L) neutral-point- clamped (NPC) bi-directional coupled quasi Z-source inverter (BCQ-ZSI) is proposed. The inductors of Z source network are coupled for the purpose of input current ripples cancellation. The detailed design of the coupled inductors have been given in terms of electrical and magnetic circuit constraints. Compared with the conventional 3L NPC QZSI, the proposed 3L NPC BCQ-ZSI can achieve completely input current ripples cancellation and also possess the capability of bi-directional power flow. The proposed 3L NPC BCQ-ZSI can avoid discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) with stable dc-link peak voltage under low power factor condition. Simulation results are presented to verify superiorities of the proposed 3L NPC BCQ-ZSI.

Abstract: In this paper, a new control method based on combination of pulse-width modulation (PWM) and phase shift is applied to high voltage gain quasi-switched boost inverter (HG-qSBI), which enlarges its voltage gain and provides soft switching for its switches. Moreover, exploiting the proposed switching algorithm will add another parameter, phase shift value, to the voltage gain equation, which will increase flexibility of the inverter. In this paper, the steady-state analysis and design procedure are given. Then, the presented HG-qSBI with proposed switching algorithm is compared with other similar inverters to evaluate its capabilities. Finally, the simulation results in PSCAD/EMTDC software are given to validate the theoretical analysis.

Abstract: This paper proposes an extended-boosting switched-capacitor embedded quasi-Z source inverter (ESC-EqZSI) topology, which is established by replacing the inductor in the impedance network of the existing active switched-capacitor embedded qZSI (ASC-EqZSI) topology with the switched-inductor (SL) cell, in order to strengthen a boost capability more. It has high boost ability with few components used in the impedance network, and can reduce a voltage stress on the switches of the inverter.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel high step-up galvanically isolated DC-DC converter topology with wide input voltage and load regulation range and fault-tolerant operation capability. The latter is based on the inherent hardware redundancy of the proposed topology, which ensures the continuity of the operation of the converter in the case of failure of any switch in the front-end full-bridge inverter by its reconfiguration intro corresponding single-switch cell. The derivation, basic operation principle and some design guidelines of the proposed converter, as well as the experimental results of a 200 W prototype, are presented and discussed. As a key study, the short-circuit fault of the MOSFET in the front-end inverter was emulated to demonstrate the topology reconfiguration principle and overall feasibility of the proposed concept.

Abstract: In many parts of the developing world, portable, rechargeable lithium-ion battery packs are being used to provide energy in areas where traditional solutions, such as micro-grids are not viable. This study provides a comparison of the effects of three charging regimes, designed to maximise either stored energy, cycle life or charge speed, on the performance of a batch of lithium-ion cells, when cycled at elevated temperature. The results show that by reducing the voltage stresses on the cell, cycle degradation can be reduced by two-thirds, thus resulting in much increased cell lifetime; this may be achieved whilst only reducing energy storage capability by around 15%. Further, it is demonstrated that significant increases in charge speed are possible without any appreciable loss in stored energy and only a modest increase in degradation over the lifetime of the cell.

Abstract: This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) approach based on the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to develop an optimal power management strategy (PMS) for minimizing the electricity bill of commercial buildings in a domestic on-grid system. The optimal PMS is first formulated as a MILP-MPC with time-varying constraints. The constraints are then linearized at each sampling time so that a receding horizon principle can be used to determine the control input applied to the plant and update the model. The time-varying efficiency of power electronic converters is evaluated for each time interval and assumed to be persistent for the prediction time horizon. The numerical results show that the proposed MILP-MPC strategy with variable efficiency is effective in utilizing photovoltaic power generation to save the cost on electricity for buildings.

Abstract: Optimal management becomes crucial for the integration of pumped-storage to distribution systems. In this paper, a Dynamic Programming (DP)-based approach is provided to optimally manage the operation of pumped- storage hydro-electric system. The DP adaptation to the hourly optimization problem is described, considering the constraints of water flow rate limitations , water consumption, minimal and maximal water levels, desired water level, electricity tariff, time period, etc. Two cases are discussed: Pumped-storage hydro-electric system and Hybrid pumped- storage wind-hydro-electric system. DP-based optimization helps make a sequence of decisions to achieve the maximum overall gained profits each day, meanwhile, the system could ensure the water supply for local residents. Comparative results for different operation regimes of both the fixed speed and variable speed are provided in the end.

Abstract: Electrical energy storage is widely used not only in the mobile applications but also in stationary applications as like uninterruptable power supply. An energy storage system with the high energy density and high-power capability is very important for some specific applications like electric vehicles (EV). Lithiumion-batteries are well known for their high energy density while super-capacitors have high power capability. Lithium-ion capacitors (LiCs) which are a hybrid energy storage technology consisting of the lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and super capacitors (SCs), combine the advantages of LIB and SC and eliminate their negative properties. However, the reliability of all types of energy storage technologies including LiCs can be drastically affected by overheating issues. These issues are more likely to happen in the closed casing battery pack. In this research, many experiments are performed to investigate the effect of current magnitude on the temperature distribution pattern in a module of 12 LiC cells. Then, in the COMSOL Multiphysics environment, a numerical solution is designed for a brief study of temperature distribution. The presented model accounts for different heat sources without getting into an electrochemical model. The simulation result shows a good agreement with the experimental results with an error of less than 5%. The presented model can be used to design a thermal management system with the focus on the hottest parts of the module.

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are playing important roles in the critical infrastructure now. A prominent family of CPSs are networked control systems in which the control and feedback signals are carried over computer networks like the Internet. Communication over insecure networks make system vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this article, we design an intrusion detection and compensation framework based on system/plant identification to fight covert attacks. We collect error statistics of the output estimation during the learning phase of system operation and after that, monitor the system behavior to see if it significantly deviates from the expected outputs. A compensating controller is further designed to intervene and replace the classic controller once the attack is detected. The proposed model is tested on a DC motor as the plant and is put against a deception signal amplification attack over the forward link. Simulation results show that the detection algorithm well detects the intrusion and the compensator is also successful in alleviating the attack effects.

Abstract: Recently several deep learning approaches have been attempted to detect malware binaries using convolutional neural networks and stacked deep autoencoders. Although they have shown respectable performance on a large corpus of dataset, practical defense systems require precise detection during the malware outbreaks where only a handful of samples are available. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the latent representations obtained through the adversarial autoencoder for malware outbreak detection. Using instruction sequence distribution mapped to a semantic latent vector, the model provides a highly effective neural signature that helps detecting variants of a previously identified malware within a campaign mutated with minor functional upgrade, function shuffling, or slightly modified obfuscations. The method demonstrates how adversarial autoencoder can turn a multiclass classification task into a clustering problem when the sample set size is limited and the distribution is biased. The model performance is evaluated on OS X malware dataset against traditional machine learning models.

Abstract: The development of software defined radio platforms and related open source software have made it possible to generate and broadcast global positioning system (GPS) signals easily and at low cost. Since GPS time is widely used in time sensitive systems for time reference, any attack on GPS can have serious consequences. This paper evaluates GPS time spoofing attacks in cyber physical systems. We explore methods to spoof the GPS time by manipulating the GPS timestamp or the signal propagation time of GPS satellite signals. In our experiments, the impact of GPS time spoofing attacks on the pseudorange, receiver location, and time errors is investigated. Our results show that when only the GPS timestamp is changed or the same delay is introduced to all signals, the resulting location error and pseudorange error can be very small, making it difficult to detect. In particular, the attacks achieved by inserting the same delay have constant location error and negligible pseudorange error. Conversely, the attacks that insert different delay to each signal or change the GPS timestamp at the same time usually lead to large location error and pseudorange error that are easy for attack detection. Moreover, the attacks that change the propagation time are difficult to distinguish irrespective of whether it can cause enough damage to violate the IEEE C37.118 standard or not.

Abstract: Due to its widespread use, with numerous applications deployed everyday, smartphones have become an inevitable target of the malware developers. This huge number of applications renders manual inspection of codes infeasible; as such, researchers have proposed several malware detection techniques based on automatic machine learning tools. Deep learning has gained a lot of attention from the malware researchers due to its ability of capture complex relationships among inputs and outputs. However, deep learning models depend largely on several hyper-parameters (i.e., learning rate, batch size, dropout rate). Hence, it is of utmost importance to analyze the effect of these parameters on classifier performance. In this paper, we systematically studied the effect of these parameters along with the effect of network architecture. We showed that building arbitrary deep networks does not always improve classifier performance. We also determined the combination of hyper-parameters that yields best result. This study will be useful in building better deep neural network based model for malware classification.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly increased the number of devices connected to the Internet ranging from sensors to multi-source data information. As the IoT continues to evolve with new technologies number of threats and attacks against IoT devices are on the increase. Analyzing and detecting these attacks originating from different sources needs machine learning models. These models provide proactive solutions for detecting attacks and their sources. In this paper, we propose to apply a supervised machine learning classification technique to identify cyber-attacks from each source. More precisely, we apply the incremental piecewise linear classifier that constructs boundary between sources/classes incrementally starting with one hyperplane and adding more hyperplanes at each iteration. The algorithm terminates when no further significant improvement of the separation of sources/classes is possible. The construction and usage of piecewise linear boundaries allows us to avoid any possible overfitting. We apply the incremental piecewise linear classifier on the multi-source real world cyber security data set to identify cyber-attacks and their sources.

Abstract: Contemporary healthcare has witnessed a wide deployment of Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs), which have the capability to be controlled remotely, making them equally accessible from both home and hospitals. The therapeutic benefits of ICDs seem to outweigh potential security concerns, yet overlooking the presence of malicious attacks cannot be justified. This study investigates the scenario where an adversary falsifies a controller command and sends instructions to issue high electric shocks in succession. We propose a novel security hardening mechanism to protect data communications between ICD and controller from malicious data manipulations. Our proposed method verifies the correctness of an external command with respect to the history of heart rhythms. The proposed method is evaluated using real data. Multi-aspect analyses show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: Manufacturing enterprises are constantly exploring new ways to improve their own production processes to address the increasing demand of customized production. However, such enterprises show a low degree of flexibility, which mainly results from the need to configure new production equipment at design and run time. In this paper we propose self-adaptation as an approach to improve data transmission flexibility in Industry 4.0 environments. We implement an autonomic manager using a generic autonomic management framework, which applies the most appropriate data transmission configuration based on security and business process related requirements, such as performance. The experimental evaluation is carried out in a MQTT infrastructure and the results show that using self-adaptation can significantly improve the trade-off between security and performance. We then propose to integrate anomaly detection methods as a solution to support self-adaptation by monitoring and learning the normal behavior of an industrial system and show how this can be used by the generic autonomic management framework.

Abstract: Common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) is an industry standard that can assess the vulnerability of nodes in traditional computer systems. The metrics computed by CVSS would determine critical nodes and attack paths. However, traditional IT security models would not fit IoT embedded networks due to distinct nature and unique characteristics of IoT systems. This paper analyses the application of CVSS for IoT embedded systems and proposes an improved vulnerability scoring system based on CVSS v3 framework. The proposed framework, named CVSSIoT, is applied to a realistic IT supply chain system and the results are compared with the actual vulnerabilities from the national vulnerability database. The comparison result validates the proposed model. CVSSIoT is not only effective, simple and capable of vulnerability evaluation for traditional IT system, but also exploits unique characteristics of IoT devices.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755193
Abstract: In this paper, two control methods based on predictive technique have been proposed for NPC grid tied inverter. The first method is the well-known Finite Set Model Predictive Controller (FS-MPC). It deals with the finite number of the converter switching states that optimizes a predefined cost function. The absence of the modulator in steady state performance results in generating variable switching frequency increasing system losses. Model Predictive Control with constant switching frequency (MPC-CSF), is introduced and discussed. The algorithm of MPC-CSF works in finding the optimal angle of the voltage vector in the first loop and then in finding the optimal amplitude of the voltage vector in the second loop. Simulations for the two proposed concepts were performed on Matlab/Simulink in order to verify their performance. Both methods are compared with respect to their complexity, simplicity, ability to inject current with low THD, dynamic response, and capacitor voltage balance.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755098
Abstract: In this paper an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) controller based on Levenberg-Marquart algorithm is designed and applied to a five-level sensor-less Packed U-cell (PUC5) inverter operating as grid connected mode. The advantage of the proposed design is that there is no longer required to the conventional parameters tuning snag confronted with the traditional Proportional Integral (PI) method. An offline algorithm takes in action of the controller parameters tuning calculation. The proposed ANN regulates the grid line current while the DC bus voltage is maintained constant with no need of regulator as the capacitor is self-voltage balanced in PUC5 topology. The overall design is simple as less tuning, sensors and regulators are requested compared to the conventional PI compensator case. Simulation results on MATLAB/Simulink are conducted to validate the performance of the controller in both steady and dynamic state where low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the line current and high dynamic system response can be identified.

Abstract: Grid-interfaced power converters are increasingly dominating electrical power grids at generation, transmission and consumption level. Especially contributed by the large-scale integration of distributed renewable energy resources to meet the worldwide ambitious goal of a sustainable future of energy supply, nowadays and future grid operators face emerging power quality and system stability issues. Grid-interfaced power converters are expected to provide ancillary system services and comply with even stricter grid code requirements. As hysteresis controllers still enjoy a great popularity, their distinctive switching frequency spectrum deteriorates the system performance. Particularly in high-power applications, switching frequencies need to be properly limited to avoid thermal loading. On the other side, low-order switching harmonics are equally undesired as system resonances due to LCL filters are excited. This paper evaluates a hysteresis-based current control approach for grid-interfaced power converters with regard to aforementioned practical issues. Experimental results demonstrate improved steady-state and dynamic performance featuring active damping capabilities and nearly constant average switching frequencies.

Abstract: The paper proposes the modeling and control of a three-level dual output voltage (TL-DOV) converter. The TL-DOV converter is mathematically modeled and incorporates the finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) algorithm. Like other multilevel converters, the proposed converter also requires capacitor voltage balancing; therefore, the control objective, along with the output current control, are included in the FCS-MPC algorithm. The performance of the TL-DOV converter is validated for common and different frequencies operating conditions using MATLAB simulations. The converter can generate high quality current waveforms of different amplitude, frequency, and phase angle at two output ports independently.

Abstract: The paper proposes an optimization formulation of the control problem for modular multilevel converter (MMC). The main control stage computes arm voltages on average over a fixed switching period by minimizing control errors in order to satisfy as best as possible the desired references of input, circulating and output currents, while taking into account arm voltage limits. Then, mean-values of required arm voltages are achieved by phase shift pulse-width modulation (PSPWM) by computing duty cycles for each submodule while taking into account the issue of active balancing of the capacitor voltages in a secondary control stage. The proposed optimization problems are solved by using a numerical method based on the simplex algorithm and simulation results are shown in order to support the validity of the approach.

Abstract: Improvement of power electronic technologies can also introduce various new types of distortions in electrical power systems due to high switching frequency of power converters. The emissions from one device can create noticeable impact on other devices connected to the same system, which may raise immunity concerns. Moreover, power line communication and ripple control signaling may have implications due to the presence of these harmonics. This paper demonstrates analysis of harmonic distortions in the frequency range of 9 - 150 kHz in low voltage distribution networks. Detailed study of voltage and current harmonics is performed based on field measurements with different load characteristics and solar inverter integration. A simulation study of 5 kW inverter control is shown to demonstrate the effect of controller strategy for current harmonics. The results could be useful in development of high frequency harmonic regulations for grid connected inverters in distribution networks.

Abstract: Power quality improvement of power electronics systems in many applications such as Adjustable Speed Drive (ASD) is vital due to high penetration of grid connected converters in distribution networks. However, due to the switching nature of the power electronics devices, ASDs have been witnessed as a major source of current harmonics in distribution networks. Due to the cost effectiveness, simplicity, and reliability, still conventional bridge diode rectifier is utilised in many three-phase systems. Thus, in this paper, a three-phase bridge rectifier with harmonic mitigation function is proposed using an electronic inductor. The proposed method can mitigate current harmonics caused by other conventional rectifiers connected at the same Point of Common Coupling (PCC). Based on the proposed harmonic reduction technique, a combination of three-phase rectifiers can comply low order harmonic emission according to IEC 61000-3-12 standard. Simulation results have been carried out to validate the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper presents a nine switch dual output (NSDO) converter topology as a power quality conditioner, using a finite control set - model predictive control (FCS-MPC) algorithm. A mathematical model is developed for the NSDO converter and is used in the FCS-MPC algorithm. The algorithm enables the NSDO converter to enhance the power quality of the grid, power control, and the DC-link voltage regulation. The performance of the model is validated through MATLAB simulations using non-linear and unbalanced linear loads. The simulation results show that the harmonics in the grid currents are well mitigated, and the DC-link voltage is regulated during severe load conditions. Moreover, the quality of grid currents agrees with the IEEE-519 standard.

Abstract: The paper presents a novel cascaded multi-output multilevel (CMOM) converter topology. The structure is composed of m converters that contain multiple n output voltage terminals. The proposed cascaded multilevel converter can provide multiple independent output voltages, and each output voltage can generate 2m+1 voltage levels. The output voltages are controlled in-terms of amplitude, frequency and phase angle independently. The mathematical model is developed for m = 2 converters with n = 2 output voltage terminals and is used in model predictive control (MFC) algorithm to optimize the control objectives. Thus the model can provide two different output voltages, each of which can generate up to five voltage levels. The performance is evaluated and demonstrated using MATLAB simulation results.

Abstract: As the industrial system evolved increasingly sophisticated in recent years, fault detection and diagnose has attracted extensive attentions either in academic or industrial field. This paper proposes a novel method of fault detection and classification that applied to an industrial system such as DC motor. The key point to this methodology is choosing the reciprocals of H∞-norm of the system and its corresponding subsystems as the feature quantities of the classifier. In the actual production process, system parameters will inevitably change. Hence, a data-driven solution is indispensable to estimate the real H∞-norm of the system and corresponding subsystems. Furthermore the reciprocals of those real-time H∞-norm of system are fed into a SVM classifier to identify the type of fault. The simulation studies based on a double loop DC motor system indicate that the scheme proposed in this paper has a relatively good accuracy and convergence.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel way for analysis of manufacturing data related to production of circuit breakers which are critical components of power distribution lines. Typically, the life span of a circuit breaker is of the order of 30 to 40 years. However, certain circuit breakers fail early within short span of 0-5 years and it's important to find out the reasons for early failure of these critical components. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to look into the manufacturing data to gain insight into the reasons for failures and provide recommendations to the manufacturer for improving the manufacturing process/operations based on these insights. The proposed approach is based on machine learning and data analytics.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8754989
Abstract: A large number of building multi-type air-conditioners are considered to be large-scale controllable loads of Fast Automated Demand Response (FastADR). The power consumption of air-conditioner can be suppressed by the power limitation command assigned to each air-conditioner by an aggregator service which controls demand side total power consumption. However, the power consumption response of each air-conditioner to the power limitation command shows sometimes indefinite stochastic behavior due to the power margin to the suppression and local embedded refrigerant controls. In this paper, we study statistical averaging effect of aggregation of a large number of power limitation responses. Since collecting samples of real-world applications in office buildings is difficult, we developed an original air-conditioner emulator model which simulates both of definite behavior and indefinite stochastic behavior. We discuss the possibility of estimation on the ensemble averaging effects using the air-conditioner emulator model.

Abstract: In this paper we focus on a practical application of data driven process monitoring for performance evaluation and anomaly detection in the operation of air source heat pumps (ASHPs). At our test site, which is a hospital building in Singapore, we install sensors to monitor the operation of a hot water heating system (10 years old) comprising of 5 ASHPs operating according to a pre-defined switching algorithm to balance their workload. We collect data for 6 consecutive months. With the help of the data and site specific conditions, we first develop a Coefficient of Performance (CoP) based technique to visualize performance degradation regarding to ASHPs and to identify patterns for early fault detection. In our monitored data, three pumps malfunctioned with easily identifiable patterns, such as, consistent under-performance or over-performance followed by longer periods of under-performance. Then, using one month data, we also train a linear regression model for each ASHP performance. This model can also be used to predict the outlet temperature as well as the performance degradation in the operation of individual ASHPs relative to the performance in the training period. The results of the linear model are consistent with our CoP technique. The proposed data driven methods can yield huge economic benefits for the hot water system operator.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) is a major topic in the field of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). A closely related concern is dimensionality reduction (DR) which is: 1) often used as a preprocessing step in an AD solution, 2) a sort of AD, if a measure of observation conformity to the learned data manifold is provided. We argue that the two aspects can be complementary in a CPPS anomaly detection solution. In this work, we focus on the nonlinear autoencoder (AE) as a DR/AD approach. The contribution of this work is: 1) we examine the suitability of AE reconstruction error as an AD decision criterion in CPPS data. 2) we analyze its relation to a potential second-phase AD approach in the AE latent space 3) we evaluate the performance of the approach on three real-world datasets. Moreover, the approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, alongside a relatively simple and straightforward application.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8754999
Abstract: A fault detection method of local outlier factor for high-speed train of running gear based on inter-variable variance is proposed which aims at solving the problems of multiple data sources, high dimension and complex actual working conditions in the process of high-speed train of fault detection in this paper. Firstly, considering the high complexity of space-time computation in big data, IVV(Inter-Variable Variance) algorithm is used to fuse data tracks with similar running states to reduce the computational complexity. Secondly, taking into the fact that the data are more affected by external factors, the linear threshold is replaced by the non-linear threshold as the standard for fault detection by horizontally comparing the other non-fault components of the same high-speed train. Lastly, in the case of determining the position of the fault components of the train initially, the LOF(Local Outlier Factor) algorithm is used to calculate the number of outliers of a single measure point, so as to determine the exact position of the fault and improve the accuracy of the algorithm. The simulation experiment is carried out in combination with the actual running data of high-speed trains, which verify the validity of the algorithm in the fault detection of high-speed train of running gear.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755082
Abstract: In various practical industrial systems, control and monitoring performances are always more or less influenced by deterministic disturbance. To improve the fault detection performance with deterministic disturbance under closed-loop conditions, two improved data-driven stable kernel representations (SKRs) based on CSIMPCA are proposed in this paper. The first one is dedicated to decouple deterministic disturbance from closed-loop systems, which implies that only the noise information will be retained in the final residual signals. The second one will emphasize the compromise between deterministic disturbance and faults whose goal is to make the identified SKR more sensitive to system faults rather than deterministic disturbance. The proposed methods are tested on a randomly generated 4-order MIMO discrete-time LTI system. Two improved data-driven SKRs are demonstrated to achieve a superior fault detection result.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755156
Abstract: An original method for multi-fault detection in synchronous machine is proposed in this paper. This method aims to answer two questions: how to detect a fault when only the normal functioning is known? How to differentiate two different faults from one fault with two severities? The proposed method relies on the use of a recursive Principal Components Analysis (PCA), which is updated each time a new fault is detected. The detection is based on a weighted distance criteria that takes into account the contribution of the different components. A geometrical criteria is also proposed to differentiate new faults from existing ones. The method has been successfully tested on a simulation database of motor currents with different levels of unbalance and eccentricity. It is then tested on real data from a 5.5 kW synchronous machine with three different levels of unbalance.

Abstract: In this work, a new data-driven approach to anomaly detection in Cyber-Physical-Production-Systems (CPPS) is developed, which uses the geometric structure non-convex hull to build a decision boundary for the classification of new observations. A novel algorithm based on Mixture-of-Experts model is presented to estimate n-dimensional non-convex hulls. Furthermore, a new method is proposed to solve the point in non-convex hull problem. With these two methods in hand, a novel algorithm for anomaly detection is developed. Compared with convex hulls based anomaly detection methods, our approach can handle data sets with arbitrary shapes. Since the presented geometric approach does not make any assumption about either the probability density or the structure of given data, it can be combined with different machine learning algorithms. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated with real world data collected from wind turbines.

Abstract: In hard disk drive manufacturing, the lapping process is a key procedure to produce high quality magnetic heads. In a lapping machine, an appropriate amount of force will be applied to lap a slider bar until reaching the target. A tilt angle can be adjusted to get an alignment between the secondary element and the primary element. The technique of tuning the tilt angle is provided in this paper. The behavior of lapping is first studied to approximate the desired path. The tracking control is then designed based on a classical control technique to follow the path. The experiments were carried out to show the effectiveness of the control scheme.

Abstract: Continuous production of wort is a challenging task in the field of beer production. In spite of all advantages which a continuous mashing process brings, it is difficult to obtain a consistent wort quality due to natural variation of malt quality. Our solution is to determine quality parameters by application of in-line and non-destructive measurement technologies and machine learing algorithms. Because of the high dimensionality of production data the natural consequence is to do dimensionality reduction. The result is a more concise space called latent space. We can verify through our laboratory plant for closed-loop controlled continuous mashing that the representation of producion data in latent space is plausible and feasible, because we can observe that the same production process lies in the same region in latent space, and in it different production processes are distinguishable from each other. This forms the basis of our new approach for quality control through data analysis in latent space, which should later lead to a correct detemination of quality parameters.

Abstract: Sustainability performance targets of products and production systems can be seen as non-functional requirements. Current manufacturing systems do not take sustainability metrics into account during production, rather sustainability performance evaluation is performed a posteriori. This research analyzes how standard manufacturing execution system (MES) functions can support building more sustainable products by extending the functions with relevant sustainability questions. We identify an approach for addressing sustainability for eleven MES functions.

Abstract: Surgeons normally need surgical scissors and tissue grippers to cut through a deformable surgical tissue. The cutting accuracy depends on the skills to manipulate these two tools. Such skills are part of basic surgical skills training as in the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery. The gripper is used to pinch a point on the surgical sheet and pull the tissue to a certain direction to maintain the tension while the scissors cut through a trajectory. As the surgical materials are deformable, it requires a comprehensive tensioning policy to yield appropriate tensioning direction at each step of the cutting process. Automating a tensioning policy for a given cutting trajectory will support not only the human surgeons but also the surgical robots to improve the cutting accuracy and reliability. This paper presents a multiple pinch point approach to modelling an autonomous tensioning planner based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Experiments on a simulator show that the proposed method is superior to existing methods in terms of both performance and robustness.

Abstract: In recent years, robots have been quickly integrated into people's daily lives. To allow the robots to navigate autonomously, accurate maps have to be provided. Therefore, it is important to make robots to obtain maps automatically and improve the efficiency of autonomous exploration. In this paper, we propose a method based on the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) and frontier 2D-SLAM exploration techniques. The proposed system is divided into three parts. First, we construct an initial map with laser range data, and use RRT and frontier detector to identify the frontier points of the initial map. The frontier points are then filtered and clustered to reduce the total number and the computation load. Finally, the score of each frontier point is calculated and the mobile robot is directed to the unknown areas until the map is constructed. In the experiments, the performance is evaluated in various synthetic scenes and real indoor environments. The results show that our system is able to successfully complete the autonomous exploration task in a reasonable time.

Abstract: Haptic teleoperation has been studied as an attractive technology for a long time. Although the haptic teleoperation has been already realized by conventional methods, their physical meanings are remained vague and unclear. This paper explains bilateral control for the haptic teleoperation using an equivalent circuit model. Owing to the circuit model, which takes into account characteristics of electrical actuators, a control strategy and its physical meanings are clearly illustrated. Torque (force) control and position (velocity) control for the haptic teleoperation can be designed independently because of mode decomposition. Feedback controller design for each control is based on analyses of sensitivity derived from the equivalent circuit. The control strategy derived from the equivalent circuit have been confirmed by experiments and resulted in the haptic teleoperation.

Abstract: Deep learning has enabled traditional reinforcement learning methods to deal with high-dimensional problems. However, one of the disadvantages of deep reinforcement learning methods is the limited exploration capacity of learning agents. In this paper, we introduce an approach that integrates human strategies to increase the exploration capacity of multiple deep reinforcement learning agents. We also report the development of our own multi-agent environment called Multiple Tank Defence to simulate the proposed approach. The results show the significant performance improvement of multiple agents that have learned cooperatively with human strategies. This implies that there is a critical need for human intellect teamed with machines to solve complex problems. In addition, the success of this simulation indicates that our multi-agent environment can be used as a testbed platform to develop and validate other multi-agent control algorithms.

Abstract: Driving simulators are cost-effective tools widely used in training, safety assessment, human factor research, virtual prototyping, etc. However, these devices suffer from workspace limitation which prevents a simulator driver from impression of a realistic driving. A Motion Cueing Algorithm (MCA) is used to produce the best motion sensation in a limited environment. Recently, Model Predictive Control (MPC) has been broadly used for MCA applications. One of the main challenges for MPC based MCA is to produce acceptable results in a real-time. A method to reduce computational burden is to decrease the prediction horizon. However, a very short prediction horizon will increase output fluctuation and unstable behavior of the output. In this paper, a terminal sample weighting method has been applied to stabilize an MPC-based MCA with a short prediction horizon and reduce the output error and undesired fluctuations. Then, a multi-objective genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the terminal sample weight in order to obtain the best realism of sensation. Computer simulations have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of human sensation improvement within the displacement restriction.

Abstract: This paper deals with the interconnection of sensors within a sensor system. A protocol for communication between the individual sensors is described. The protocol is based on a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus implementation of the sensor system and includes the setup management, reliable data transfer, and actuator control. An appropriate message design guarantees little traffic on the bus and fast transmission for high-priority messages. As sensor systems are able to run on various communication levels, how the protocol can be transferred into other communication levels is also illustrated. This means that not only is the CAN protocol supported, but also wireless and wired Local Area Networks (LAN) as well as low level communication standards. The protocol setup is exemplarily illustrated based on a sensor network that allows all three standards and therefore the combination of the various communication protocols in one sensor network.

Abstract: Recent advancement in the development of embedded systems and in the integration of operational and industrial technologies has accelerated the progress of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) development. Cooperation of such systems allows to achieve new functionalities. However, often these systems are time-critical; hence, the developers of these systems are required to provide guarantees of the systems' properties, such as predictability and security. In this paper, we start by glancing through the research devoted to developing time predictable and secure embedded systems. Thereon, we extend the discussion to time-critical and secure CPSs and point out the challenges related to ensuring predictability during their development. In this context, we emphasize the importance of security as a prerequisite for time predictability. Moreover, we identify the gaps in the state of the art and describe our view on ensuring predictability in time-critical and secure CPSs.

Abstract: Software systems typically consist of various interacting components and units. While these components can be tested and shown to work correctly in isolation, when integrated and start interacting with each other, they may fail to produce the desired behaviors and results. Integration testing plays an important role in revealing issues in interactions among cooperating components. Identifying different interaction scenarios, however, is not a trivial task when performing integration testing. On the other hand, most of the integration testing solutions proposed in the literature are manual which hinders their scalability and applicability when it comes to large industrial systems. In this paper we introduce IntegrationDistiller as an automated solution and tool to identify integration scenarios and generate test cases (in the form of method call sequences) for .NET applications. It works by analyzing the code and automatically identifying class couplings, interacting methods, as well as invocation points. Moreover, the tool also helps and supports testers in identifying timing issues at integration level by automatic code instrumentation at invocation points. The code analysis engine of IntegrationDistiller is built and automated using .NET compiler platform, known as Roslyn. Hence, this work is the first in utilizing Roslyn features for automatic integration analysis and integration test case generation. This work has been done as part of our collaboration with ABB Industrial Automation Control Technologies (IACT) in Västerås-Sweden to address the integration testing challenges of the software part of the ABB Ability™ 800xA distributed control systems.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755245
Abstract: Future cyber-physical systems (CPS) require their components to perform autonomously. To do that safely and efficiently, CPS components will need access to the global state of the whole CPS. These components will require near real-time updates to a subset of the global state to react to changes in the environment. A particular challenge is to monitor state updates from the distributed CPS components: one needs to ensure that only states consistent with the PDDL plan execution semantics can be observed within the system. In order to guarantee that, a component to monitor plan execution is proposed. Microservices based on Linked Data technologies are used to provide a uniform way to access component states, represented as Resource Description Framework (RDF) resources. To ensure the correct ordering of state updates, we present an extension of the OASIS OSLC TRS protocol. Specifically, we strengthen the ordering guarantees of state change events and introduce inlining of the state with the events to prevent state mismatch at the dereferencing stage.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755012
Abstract: There has been very little exploration when it comes to design distributed detection techniques and data fusion rules with non-identical sensors. This concept can be utilized in many possible applications within industrial automation, surveillance and safety. Here, for a global event, some of the sensors/detectors in the network can observe the full set of the hypotheses, whereas the remaining sensors infer more than one hypotheses as a single hypothesis. The local decisions are sent to the decision fusion center (DFC) over a multiple access wireless channel. In this paper, a fusion rule based on minimization of variance of the local mis-detection is proposed. The presence of sensors with limited detection capabilities is found to have a positive impact on the overall system performance, both in terms of probability of detection and transmit power consumption. Additionally, when the DFC is equipped with a large antenna array, the overall transmit power consumption can be reduced without sacrificing the detection performance.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8754967
Abstract: Passive filters are inevitable for power electronic converters with grid coupling. In this context LCL filter topologies are a recognized cost and space reducing alternative to single coil solutions for grid current harmonic attenuation. Since this type of filter represents a third order plant, a simple PI controller can cause instabilities once applied to control the grid current of such filter. A common approach is the addition of a so called active damping to the PI-controller. Usually specific state variables are fed back via additional filters to overcome the oscillation problem. However, straight forward solutions regarding the parameter design of these filters can hardly be found. Within this article an extensive stability analysis is presented based on the Hurwitz criteria as applied to a simplified continuous plant model. As a result not only clear guide lines can be given to identify impending instabilities. Furthermore, an easy to implement active damping solution can be accurately designed to ensure robust operation.

Abstract: Impedance source inverters (Z-source and Quazi-Z-source (QZS)) are the promising converter topologies in the future generation because of the buck, boost and buck-boost modes of operation. In this paper, three phase voltage sensorless grid connected QZS inverter is proposed to inject Maximum Direct Power. The new system uses the Virtual Flux Oriented Control (VFOC) algorithm for current control and virtual Flux (VF) estimation method for grid voltage. The complete Virtual Flux direct Power control (VFOC-DPC) exemplify the performance and operation of the proposed system compared to the conventional DPC algorithm is presented. Proposed strategy is also investigated under predistorted and unbalance grid conditions. VFOC-DPC provides numerous benefits mainly providing balanced sinusoidal line currents when the supply voltage is unbalanced. Simulation results are presented under unbalanced and pre-existing harmonic content in the grid voltage to verify the VF estimation of grid voltage. Tracking of active- reactive power is accurately done with current control loops providing good steady state and transient response to step change in reference.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755009
Abstract: This paper presents a fast non-parametric detection method for multiple infrared small dim targets against the complex sky background. Traditional methods are based on the entire image processing with a high requirement of accuracy and speediness. However, the proposed method divides the detection into regions of interest (ROIs) searching and precise positioning according to the idea that from coarse searching to precise positioning. The former pays more attention to accuracy while the latter is more concentrated on speediness. First, ROIs sequence can be built by stationary wavelet transform (SWT) followed by Sobel direction directors. Through Hough line transformation, target region proposals which are settled as prior information of precise positioning can be extracted from ROIs sequence. Then, exact target positions are located by auto-regression analysis of temporal profile. Only the max size of targets is assumed which dramatically reduces the dependence of the method on target parameters. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can rapidly locate multiple targets simultaneously in real-time.

Abstract: In this paper, the consensus problem of multiple Lur'e systems over directed graphs is considered, where only relative output information between neighboring agents is used to generate the distributed protocols. The main difficulty lies in the coupling between the design of distributed observer and adaptive protocol. To overcome such difficulty, the idea of unknown input observer is borrowed to propose distributed observers, based on which a fully distributed adaptive protocol is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed adaptive protocol is verified by numerical simulations. The adaptive protocol is designed in a fully distributed way, depending only on relative output information between neighboring agents, without using the information of the global communication graph.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the practical formation tracking problem of networked underactuated vehicles (NUVs) on group SE(3) in the case of directed interaction topologies. To solve the aforementioned problem, a new class of estimator-based nonlinear controller is designed based on distributed sliding mode estimators. Based on the Lyapunov theory, the practical convergence property of the closed-loop system is analyzed and the corresponding sufficient criteria for solving the considered problem are obtained.

Abstract: This paper addresses the stability analysis for cooperative control of heterogeneous multi-agent systems with nonlinear dynamics under a directed communication topology. Differently from existing works that focus mainly on the consensus for homogeneous multi-agent systems, a novel view which outside of the cases in the literature is proposed to achieve the complete consensus for the closed-loop heterogeneous multi-agent systems under a leader-follower framework. Specifically, we reveal that the stability analysis for the heterogeneous multi-agent systems cannot be held, if the controller is designed only by the neighbors’ interaction information and the state feedback gain. The advancement of the proposed approach was further validated by the applications to the problems of obstacle avoidance and formation flight control for heterogeneous multi-vehicle systems with nonlinear dynamics.

Abstract: The modular multilevel converter (MMC) using half-bridge submodules (HBSMs) cannot clear the DC-side short-circuit current by itself. Various improved MMC topologies based on clamped circuit have been proposed to provide DC fault blocking capability. The extra conduction loss caused by the extra switches in the clamped circuit is an important concern for choosing converter topology. The combination of cross-connected module (CCM) with HBSMs provides DC fault blocking capability and leads to a low number of extra semiconductor switches. Integrated gate commutated thyristor (IGCT) has superior characteristic of low conduction voltage drop and high blocking voltage rating. In this study, in order to reach lowest extra loss, IGCTs are proposed to be used as the semiconductor switches in the CCM. The topology and operating principle of the proposed IGCT-based CCM (ICCM) are presented. The design of a ±10 kV/10 MW ICCM-MMC is presented and the DC fault clearance characteristic are analyzed. Loss evaluation results show that the ICCM-MMC have the lowest extra loss compared to other MMC solutions with DC fault blocking capability. The DC fault clearance capability of the ICCM-MMC is verified using the simulation results.

Abstract: Multilevel converters have many advantages in power electronics. This paper presents a new topology of multilevel converter based on flying capacitors that allows to increase the number of output voltage levels reducing the numbers of semiconductors necessary in comparison with the standard multilevel converters like Flying Capacitor Converter (FCC) and Stacked Multicell Converter (SMC). In particular, the proposed converter, Reduced Multilevel Converter (RMC), is an attractive choice as it can generate high quality output waveforms and reach high power levels. Several works have been presented in the literature for voltage capacitor balancing, relying on self-balancing properties for FCC and SMC. Nevertheless, the conditions for self-balancing operation cannot be guaranteed or achieved easily in the proposed multilevel converter. In this paper, a simple closed-loop scheme, based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), is used to properly modulate the converter output voltage in order to keep the capacitor voltages at the desired values. As the proposed modulation strategy regulates the capacitor voltages, fast linear controllers can be used for the current tracking, improving the dynamic behavior of the overall system.

Abstract: The paper investigates adaptive proportional-resonant controllers in stationary reference frame used for suppression of second harmonic circulating current in the modular multilevel converter especially for lower controller bandwidth. The current controller is implemented as an IIR filter. The resonant frequency of the controller is altered by changing the coefficient in one method and by changing sampling time in the other. Lower THD and reduction in magnitude of second harmonic component of the circulating current is obtained for controller with coefficient modification than the sample-time variation. Both the methods use PLL for detection of change in frequency.

Abstract: Voltage stability and power factor control are two key points in steady state operation of electrical systems. STAT-COM and its control system can be used to improve the power system performance. A model predictive controller with a new approach of reference generation is used. The proposed control method compensates the imaginary power required to maintain a chosen power factor at the end of the transmission line. To evaluate the performance of the proposed control method, 10 kV distribution network is examined in simulation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy improves the power factor and stabilize the voltage at the Point of Common Coupling.

Abstract: Multilevel inverters are used in high-power medium-voltage applications, due to lower harmonics and the lower standing voltage on the power switches than conventional two and three multilevel inverters. The main drawback of multilevel inverters is, requires a high number of switching devices leads to complex their control. This paper introduces an asymmetric switch-diode multilevel inverter for cascaded multilevel inverters. The suggested asymmetric multilevel inverter generates thirty-one-levels with the reduced number of power switches and DC power supplies as well as reduced the maximum total blocking voltage on the switches. A comprehensive study among the suggested topology and other cascaded multilevel inverters are discussed to show the advantages and disadvantages of multilevel inverters. The performance of a single-phase cascaded connection consists of the two suggested multilevel inverter is evaluated in Matlab/Simulink software.

Abstract: Multilevel inverters are widely used in the medium voltage energy market. Among them, the Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) and Modular Multilevel Inverter (MMC) stand out for their modular hardware, which allows the easy replacement of their modules in the case of failures. Normally, these converters are operated with centralized control schemes, which require a large processing capacity, multiple digital outputs and wires for the switching signals of the transistors. The use of a centralized controller reduces the modularity of the system and generates difficulties as the number of inverters connected in series (cells) increases. In this work, a distributed control strategy for CHB converters is proposed, allowing each cell to have an independent local controller, which increases the modularity of the multilevel converter without deteriorating the performance of the system. Extensive simulations are carried out, showing the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed distributed control strategy offers when compared to a PI current controller on dq axes and Shifted PWM. The proposed control scheme is also tested under fault conditions and is finally applied in a Field Oriented Control (FOC) of a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM), in order to evaluate its performance in electrical drives applications.

Abstract: The multi-level converters are more and more used for high power medium voltage applications. They seem to be the best option to reduce the weight of the converter and still have high efficiency. However, they should be used with an adapted control strategy to reduce their power losses that could be high due to the used high switching frequencies and also to improve the output harmonics quality. The commonly used PWM strategy can lead to high switching losses and less output harmonic content in comparison with full wave modulation. This paper aims to explain the limits of PWM modulation for our application and the advantages of full wave modulation adapted to multilevel converters. These control strategies will be compared for 3-level FC, and 3-level NPC topologies and their effect on the converter weight and performances will be studied to find the most interesting solution regarding specific power and inverter efficiency.

Abstract: Multilevel inverters are worked on medium-voltage and high-power applications due to their ability to supply high power quality output voltage. Hence, a low switching frequency strategy is applied in high power applications since it generates lower magnitudes of harmonics than high switching frequency. In this paper, to eliminate high selective harmonic in a 15-level cascaded multilevel inverter, a genetic algorithm approach is proposed. Genetic algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm to determine switching angles 15-level cascaded multilevel inverters in order to eliminate selective harmonic. This paper calculates the optimum angles as offline to eliminate harmonics 3rd, 5th,7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th and 17th along with their multiples. Then, the obtained angles are applied to simulation results to validate the approach performance.

Abstract: Phase-shifted full bridge(PSFB), half bridge zero-current-switching(HBZCS), LLC resonant converter are three typical topologies widely used in DC/DC conversion scenario. However, when it is applied in high power conversion system, especially in locomotive traction, it is rarely discussed for the quantitative comparison of DC/DC topology to find the optimum design. This paper presents a comprehensive comparison among three typical and mature zero-voltage switching(ZVS)/ zero-current switching (ZCS) isolated bridge structure DC/DC converters in terms of cost and efficiency and reveals their intrinsic advantages and disadvantages. After the theoretical analysis of operation principle and parameter design, an example of 160kW 4kHz DC/DC conversion based on three topologies is designed. Finally, the comparison result shows PSFB converter has obvious advantages in efficiency while HBZCS converter in cost.

Some challenges for this type of systems are reducing the cost and increasing the efficiency.The components reduction is discussed in this paper, by integrating two stages of the SST; the ac/dc converter and the DAB converter share one leg. The proposed scheme is described and numerically simulated.

Abstract: Even if intrinsically a five-phase machine can work with one opened phase, thermal constraints (temperatures in windings and Permanent Magnets) impose to decrease the mean torque in faulty operation mode. In order to elaborate optimum control which ensures safety and maximum torque, it is necessary to estimate in real-time the temperatures induced by the currents imposed in the remaining healthy windings of the machine. For a five-phase prototype, a multi-nodal thermal modelling which can take into account irregular losses and flow distribution has been developed. It is based on Electromagnetic FEM results for the losses and CFD calculation analysis. Results are presented in normal and faulty operation modes.

Abstract: This paper studies control strategies using modified transformation matrices when five-phase machines operate in one-open-phase faults. The basic idea of these methods is to maintain the rotating field under asymmetrical conditions as the same as in healthy condition by determining new transformation matrices. The dimension of the new matrices is equal to the number of remaining healthy phases in post-fault conditions. There have been different ways to determine the new transformation matrices applied for different types of five-phase machines in recent decades. In this study, an overview and analyses on these methods will be presented. In addition, advantages and drawbacks of these control strategies are clarified by numerical results.

Abstract: It is known that an extreme high level of sound pressure will lead to permanent hearing damage. The limit of sound pressure level was specified in many areas, such as occupational health and safety, environmental protection testing and consumer product safety testing. The sound pressure level emitted by consumer products is normally measured inside an acoustic room in order to minimize the effect of other sound source, including the reflected sound. It is critical to determine if the acoustic room is suitable or not for measuring sound pressure. This paper discusses two environmental correction factor determination methods for acoustic rooms and compares their operating cost and equipment investment. By using the newest the sound pressure analyzer, the measured data can be used for smart systems and internet-based solution.

CPS applications in total productive maintenance (TPM) were proposed by some researchers that aim to monitor the machinery performance for improving the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) of the manufacturing industry. Although product safety is one of the critical competences in the comprehensive market competition, it is seldom documented in CPS. This paper sought to discuss the opportunities of applying CPS in the new product development process in pre-design and post-design stages for improving product safety in toy products proactively. An overview of CPS applications, consumer product safety and integration methods in manufacturing industry will be presented in this paper. Opportunities in applying CPSC data with CPS to product safety will also be addressed.

Abstract: This paper outlines the methodology of designing and developing a smart control system for controlling light, air conditioning and ceiling fans in a room. This system considers the requirements of the users appropriately and makes a comfort zone for the users. An android application with a user friendly Graphical Interface, which is easy to communicate with the smart control system, has been developed. The application is connected with the control system through Wi-Fi across a cloud network and it can respond quickly. RGB LED panel light system that controls the color, color temperature and luminance was designed by considering the requirements of the instances and lighting conditions. Although there are RGB LED panel lights available, there are no systems defined for the activity based color modes. An IR Remote module controller system was built for controlling inverter type air conditioners by giving commands from a smart phone application. This system considers the mean value of the preferences of many users to control the air conditioning system. The running mode of the air conditioner is chosen from the data given through the application by many users in a same place. Although the inverter type air conditioners continuously regulate the temperatures, the fan does not do it. Because of this problem, a ceiling fan controlling system with two modes, automatic and manual, was designed. Automatic mode utilizes the users skin moisture related hybrid system to set the room temperature. Manual mode works according to the suggestions given by the crowd just as the air conditioning system. This air conditioning and ceiling fan control system that works according to the suggestions of crowd is better than the individual preference system using a conventional remote controller.

Abstract: Electric vehicles with stepped automatic transmissions provide benefits for improve drive performance and lower energy consumption. To deliver the desired operational functionality of power-on shifting for all driving states, this paper presents a novel methodology for the achievement of power-on gear shifts during regenerative braking events in electric vehicles equipped with multi-speed transmissions. Separate algorithms are developed for upshift and downshift events, where the control of clutches is considered for both torque and inertia phases of these events. Consideration is given primarily to the delivery of negative friction torque through the clutches during the inertia phase of gear change. A multi-body dynamic model of a dual clutch transmission equipped powertrain is then developed, including a DC equivalent motor model and piecewise clutch models, to evaluate the performance of these clutch control algorithms. Results of these simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of these shift control strategies and the capacity to maintain brake torque to the road during shift events.

Abstract: This paper shows the effectiveness for employing the GaN-FET inverter for operating the traction motor of a compact Electric Vehicle. Utilizing GaN-FET inverter can not only reduce the conduction loss, but also reduce the switching loss. Therefore GaN-FET inverter can operate motors in higher switching frequency compared with Si-IGBT inverters. It is effective to increase the switching frequency of the inverter to improve the motor efficiency because harmonic iron losses can be reduced dramatically by increasing the switching frequency, but the inverter loss becomes relatively large when the switching frequency is set too high. Therefore, optimized switching frequency should be obtained to maximize the total efficiency of the motor drive system. Experiments are carried out to compare efficiencies of motor drive system with Si-IGBT/GaN-FET inverter in several switching frequencies. Optimization of the switching frequency for maximizing the total efficiency is demonstrated to make effective use of the GaN-FET inverter in the motor drive system.

Abstract: Responding to the latest developments in information communication technology, the connected car that support autonomous driving or services is actively underway. A connected car is a vehicle connected to an external network through wireless communication. It improves user convenience and stability of vehicle through various external connections. However, there is a problem of security against intrusion from the outside. This security issues are resolved by encrypting the entire data within the controller area network (CAN) network system, but that can be time-consuming and cause the authentication process to be carried out in the event of a certification procedure. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an intrusion detection algorithm for the in-vehicle network of the connected car. The proposed algorithm can detect encryption and authentication techniques by detecting and identifying external intruders when identifying external intruder's password and authentication techniques. Additionally, we develop an intrusion detection algorithm to minimize the burden of the vehicle's electronic control unit (ECU) a system using node authentication algorithm.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel dual-input powertrain for series-parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) which includes one engine, two motors/generators (MGs), and a dual-input automated manual transmission (AMT). Although hybrid powertrain with multi-power sources have been recognized that has great potential to improve fuel economy, the challenge here is how to manage the operation of the powertrain elements. To do this, firstly, the powertrain configuration is analysed in detail, all operating modes, such as in accelerating and decelerating condition, are presented. Secondly, the simulation model of the powertrain system is built. Thirdly, a power-split strategy is proposed to manage the power flow aiming at minimize total energy consumption. Finally, the simulation result is compared between vehicle adopted proposed series-parallel configuration and a traditional parallel type. The results demonstrate that the proposed series-parallel powertrain and power-split strategy have the ability to keep engine and MGs working in high efficiency regions. Furthermore, the coordination of the powertrain elements makes the series-parallel HEV achieve better performances without any compromising in energy efficiency compared to the equivalent parallel HEV.

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has made significant progress in recent decades. For fully autonomous driving of an electric vehicle, the recharging process should be possible without a manually fixed connection. Wireless charging technology is a promising solution for electric vehicle recharging automation. The wireless transformer/coupler is the key component in electric vehicle wireless charging. The maximum power transfer capability and efficiency are limited by the coupler. To reach the required power level, efficiency and electromagnetic exposure to surrounding area, the coupler should be analyzed. In this paper, a coupler with assistive coils is presented and analyzed. The assistive coils perform as reactive shielding coils as well as flux concentrating coils. Finite element simulation and circuit simulation results are shown.

Abstract: The popularisation of the Electric Vehicle (EV) is restrained by the stagnation of energy storage technology and inadequate plug-in charging stations. This paper proposes a new vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging technology platform, that can achieve wireless charging working in harmony with plug-in charging technology, or operate independently. V2V charging technology can effectively solve the problem of the limited number of plug-in stations. Moreover, it can charge the car any-time, anywhere, like a power bank. V2V charging system design requires a number of technical challenges to be overcome including the power balancing between vehicles and charging circuit design to maximizing the power transfer efficiency. In this paper, the schematic of V2V charging system is proposed, and we also propose the fundamentals of calculating the power capacity and the cost of EV energy when an EV is a power source in a V2V charging system. The hardware circuit design is presented and a detailed comparison of different coil shapes/ combinations and compensation circuit topologies is provided using the simulation tool ANSYS.

Abstract: A doubly-grounded transformer-less single-phase PV inverter with boost capability is proposed. The leakage current does not exist in the proposed topology. This PV inverter can operate at boost mode under shading condition. Only one switch operates at high frequency in each mode. In addition, the boost converter only operates at shading condition, so the efficiency of the system at normal condition is not affected. Operating principle of the proposed inverter is illustrated. Finally, simulation results verify the theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Virtual Synchronous Machines (VSM) are proposed to support a power grid with high penetration of inverter-based distribution generation (DG) units. When the number of inverters connected to a grid increases, grid lacks the inertia that conventionally is introduced by the synchronous machine (SM). Therefore, VSMs are proposed to virtually introduce such inertia back into the power grid. Moreover, VSMs are able to control the inverter in both grid connected and stand alone modes of operation with seamless transition. This paper proposes a VSM controller for single stage inverters. The proposed controller uses the input source power to provide inertial response for the grid. In this paper, the proposed controller is developed, the system is modeled and its stability is analyzed, and simulation and experimental results are presented to verify its performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new non-isolated, high step-up DC-DC converter to interface renewable sources into DC microgrid. The topology utilizes the coupled inductor and switched capacitor techniques to achieve high step-up voltage conversion ratio. The leakage energy is directly transferred to output to avoid voltage spikes across the switch. The switching devices have relatively low voltage stresses. In addition, the coupled inductor alleviated the reverse recovery problem of the diode. The key features include high efficiency, low voltage stresses, and low component count and cost. The steady-state analysis and operation of the proposed converter are presented in detail. Finally, a 200 W prototype circuit operating at a switching frequency of 100 kHz is built in the laboratory to verify the performance. The experimental results substantiate the theoretical analysis and show a peak efficiency of 96.90%.

Abstract: This paper presents a switched-capacitor integrated (2N+1)-level (N≥2) boost inverter for single-phase photovoltaic (PV) applications. It consists of N modular switching cells, where each cell consists of two switched capacitors and three active switching elements. A boost converter at the front side of the switching cells helps to maintain the capacitor voltage balance during different operation modes. With this arrangement, the inverter is capable to generate 2N+1 output voltage levels, and able to accommodate a wide range of input voltage. Detailed analysis followed by simulation and experimental results of a 5-level inverter as an example is presented to verify the proposed concept. Further, comparison with other multilevel inverter topologies is presented to show the merit of the proposed concept.

Abstract: Smart Grids is a modern concept of electric power network that aims with its infrastructure to improve efficiency, reliability and safety through automated control and modern communication technologies. In smart grids, more and more sources of renewable energy, photovoltaic, wind, biomass, etc., will be located on the side of stakeholders (distributed generation), due to environmental concerns and financial advantages. In addition, the generation of energy near the places where it is consumed, allows to reduce significantly the losses in the transmission lines associated with the power supply and to significantly relieve the congestion due to the limited capacity of these networks. This work presents a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) real-time simulator testbed using the emulator OP57071, from OPAL-RT Technologies, with a digital signal processor (DSP) board TivaC2 TM4C1294NCPDT, from Texas Instruments. This testbed makes possible to evaluate the impact of the control of the distributed generation (DG) sources in the electrical power grid. Different analyzes can be carried out using different inputs and outputs for the most diverse operational possibilities of the DG system under study. Experimental results are presented demonstrating the feasibility of the developed testbed.

Abstract: The growing number of intermittent distributed generations units has increased the voltage regulation challenges in distribution networks. This paper proposes a joint voltage regulation in medium voltage and low voltage distribution feeders by employing and coordinating both traditional and emerging approaches. The proposed technique is a three-stage control strategy that suits well the integrated and unbalanced radial distribution networks. In this technique, the reactive power support of delta-connected switched capacitors, installed at the medium voltage feeders, are coordinated with that of the PV inverters, available at low voltage feeders. Factors such as the network's power loss, as well as the voltage magnitude and balance profiles, are aimed to be improved. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed volt-var optimization model is evaluated by numerical analysis on a real typical distribution network over a 24-hour period.

Abstract: With the increasing economic development, it is becoming more difficult for traditional distribution networks to meet new technical requirements, and as such the active distribution network has emerged. To obtain the statuses of active distribution networks accurately for reasonable planning and operation, it is necessary to address the load flow problem of three-phase unbalanced active distribution networks, with multiple voltage levels and high distributed generation (DG) penetrations. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved direct load flow approach that suits the load flow requirements of active unbalanced distribution networks of multiple voltage levels and network configurations. Through detailed numerical simulation and analyses, the computational performance of the proposed improved direct load flow approach has been tested in terms of feasibility, efficiency and robustness, with a promising application value.

Abstract: This study develops a comprehensive Small Signal Stability Analysis (SSSA) framework model for solar Photo-voltaics (PV) and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) integrated islanded microgrids. This model incorporates dispatchable Distributed Generators (DG), and solar PV energy source and BESS. The proposed SSSA analytical model investigates the stability of a microgrid when varying PV output power and BESS output power that are integrated into the microgrid system. The development of this analytical model utilizes the latest microgrid modeling methodologies where dynamics of power converters, dynamics of loads, primary (droop) control method and secondary control method are systematically integrated. In this work, modal analysis presents a full picture of the stability of the microgrid with a diverse range of parameters. The proposed SSSA model developed in this study, with great scalability and applicability, can serve as a useful tool for microgrid establishment and analyses in determining the optimal uptake of solar PV energy, sizing of BESS, and also the control parameters for the purpose of maximizing the stability of a microgrid.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for an energy control of a DC microgrid. It combines decentralized grid management and energy management. For this purpose, the conventional voltage droop curves are extended to a characteristic diagram with electricity costs as a further dimension. The support points of these characteristic diagrams are then optimized with a particle swarm optimizer. The target criterion of this optimization is a monetary cost function, that takes several effects, such as depth of discharge, on the operating costs into account. The optimized characteristic diagrams are designed more robust by a sensitivity analysis. The proposed method has been tested successfully in simulations and experiment and was always more cost-efficient than the initial characteristics diagram.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755019
Abstract: The conventional droop control is a widely-used technique to share loads in islanded low voltage (LV) DC networks, known as autonomous DC Microgrids (MG), using a fully-decentralized control method. This method provides plug-and-play (PnP) capability for distributed generation (DG) units. However, it suffers from poor voltage regulation, and to get higher accuracy in load sharing (LS), more voltage drop would entail. While implementing centralized or distributed control is a solution to tackle this shortcoming, it sacrifices the PnP feature of DG units. Furthermore, due to the presence of communication links to a central controller or between DG unit controllers, less reliability occurs. Thus, more investigation to improve the performance of islanded DC MGs is needed. This paper studies simultaneous LS and voltage regulation through a decentralized control method. To verify feasibility of the proposed method, it is proved that by getting local feedback of the terminal voltages and adjusting the local controller parameters including droop control reference voltage, accurate LS and negligible voltage drop are concurrently achievable. In addition, an islanded DC Microgrid as a test system is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink to validate the proposed controlling system scheme.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755194
Abstract: Renewable energy sources are increasingly replacing conventional fossil-fueled power plants in electric power systems around the world. As a result, the frequency excursions have become high due to the low synchronous inertia remaining in the system. An example is South Australia, where the generation mix heavily depends on renewable energy sources. Therefore, when South Australia is subjected to a non-credible contingency such as a network separation, the impact of governor dead-bands towards frequency stability can be significant. In this work, the influence of governor dead-bands on frequency nadir and quasi steady-state frequency is investigated. In turn, their effect towards the services, which are operating outside the normal operating frequency band, such as load shedding and frequency control services is discussed.

Abstract: Microgrids are becoming integral parts of the new power system structure where induction machines (IMs) constitute a significant portion of the system loads. This paper investigates the dynamic behaviour of various induction machines in microgrids and their related issues such as low-frequency oscillations (LFOs). This study also compare the dynamic performance of multiple parallel small IMs with a large IM of same power rating over a wide range of operating conditions using eigenvalue analysis and non-linear dynamic simulations considering different model parameters and voltage/frequency transients across the IM terminals. The results indicate that the IM rotor resistance is the most significant parameter which affects the dynamic behaviour of the machine while voltage and frequency transients lead to LFOs in the microgrid. Furthermore, the LFO damping capability of large IMs is found to be less than the small IMs while the system frequency with single large IM has shown one dominant LFO compared to multiple low frequency modes of the system with parallel small IMs.

Abstract: A new approach for more energy efficient industrial production processes are smart industrial direct current (DC) microgrids with one or more connections to the alternative current (AC) grid. The advantage of the DC-technology is an easier integration of renewable energies sources and energy storage systems (ESS). Different applications for ESS are possible, for instance an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for a DC microgrid. Within this paper, a new handling concept for a mains supply failure (e.g. a blackout of the supplying AC grid) with a droop curve control is introduced. In this approach, the droop curve controlling the ESS is adapted, depending on the ESS' state of charge (SoC), which results in a droop curve with a hysteresis. This concept realizes the charging of the ESS only with recuperation energy, that occurs in the DC microgrid during the production process. Thus, all recuperation energy will be kept in the DC microgrid and a transformation of the energy in AC or an energy loss through braking resistors will be avoided. Furthermore, no additional energy is needed to charge the ESS. This increases the energy efficiency of the entire production process. The concept was verified in simulation and validated in experiment and it has shown a DC voltage deviation of less than two percent.

Abstract: An autonomous microgrid is susceptible to the uncertainties in the variations of its demand and the generation of its non-dispatchable renewable sources. Such events can result in the voltage or frequency of the microgrid to exceed beyond their allowed ranges. Some methods are proposed in the literature to predict such events a few minutes ahead. As such, the voltage and frequency violation of a microgrid can be predicted and prevented with the introduction of an appropriately designed preventive controller. The key factor to be considered is the accuracy of the prediction tools, based on which the preventive controller is designed. This paper proposes a look-ahead controller that is complemented by considering various scenarios, as the result of considering the prediction inaccuracies and their probabilities. The sensitivity of the performance of such a preventive controller with respect to the prediction error is also studied in this paper through extensive numerical analysis in MATLAB.

Abstract: A strong relationship exists between the relevancy of sense data and the location of the data's origin. Current methods for localisation are too demanding on the resources of constrained devices or have high estimation errors. Software Defined Networks has the potential to offload computational and power draw requirements of localisation techniques into the controller of the network. This paper explores, categorises and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of current localisation techniques in Wireless Sensor Networks. With this in mind, the Software Defined Wireless Sensor Networking paradigm for localisation is introduced and discussed comparing some of the latest works which has been done in literature. This discussion shows that the Software Defined Wireless Sensor Network paradigm can increase network lifetime and the accuracy of localisation algorithms.

Abstract: Constant progress in power electronics and growing participation of renewable sources in a total energy market results in much interest of Energy Storages (ES) as well. Their popularity implies increasing power ranges what often may be assured by parallel connection of DC/DC ES converters for example in an Input Parallel Output Parallel (IPOP) manner. On the other hand, varying voltage of the ES results in various power range of the system, thus in given conditions all parallel operating converters are not necessarily required and may even worsen the overall efficiency. Then, a dynamic connection or disconnection (engaging and dismissing) of parallel devices is required regarding to actual power demands and ES's voltage level. When the Dual Active Bridge (DAB) converter is used as the DC/DC topology it may be easily performed by setting zero signals for all transistors of the whole converter. Unfortunately, repetitive engaging and dismissing the whole converter module stresses its components such high frequency transformer's and power mosfets. This may result in harmful EMF introduction and affects overall reliability. This paper presents a simple method to improve process within a two-module IPOP DAB system in a manner where currents overshoots are reduced. It is achieved by adequate modulation modification and proper perfilter application. The idea is finally validated by simulation.

Abstract: To estimate the core loss in SRMs, core loss estimation by equivalent circuit is preferable especially in the EV development because of its simple calculation. However, previously proposed models may limit applicable operating condition. These models refer instantaneous value, whereas hysteresis loop is a key factor to estimate core loss and the hysteresis loop directly associates with the history of magnetic flux. This paper focuses on the relation between the width of hysteresis loop and the peak to peak value of magnetic flux because the relation directly expresses the core loss. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose a novel core loss model for equivalent circuit which estimates core loss in SRMs. This paper refers the peak to peak value of magnetic flux linkage and electrical angle. Along with the theoretical formulation of the model, this paper presents the model construction method. As a result, the proposed model successfully estimated core loss.

Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have made a substantial impact in our lives by allowing us to communicate, monitor certain environments thus enabling us to build systems such as software-defined wireless sensor networks (SDWSN) which are expected to contribute a lot on the design of many applications in future. Software-defined wireless sensor networks decouple the control plane and data plane. The control plane serves as the brain of the system while the data plane performs functions such as data aggregation, packet generation and transmission in the programmable nodes. Flow aggregation allows a limited number of flow entries to be reduced while maximizing utilities. It also improves the energy consumptions, security, overall throughput performance and network lifetime. Therefore, this paper investigates data aggregation in network technologies such as WSN and SDN and proposes flow aggregation for control packets in software-defined wireless sensor networks.

Abstract: This paper discusses the design of distributed structures and gains for estimation of sensor network with nonlinear uncertain dynamics. Each sensor estimates the system state not only on its own but also on its neighbors' information. Besides, these sensors communicate with their neighbors over a random communication topology, i.e., their measurements are transmitted randomly at every step. In addition, both the system uncertainties and its linearization errors are taken into consideration in this paper. It is strictly proved that an optimized upper bound of the estimation error covariance with respect to the proposed filtering method can be achieved.

Abstract: Smart maintenance strategies are becoming increasingly important in the industry, and can contribute to environmentally and economically sustainable production. In this paper a recently developed latent variable framework for nonlinear-system identification is considered for use in smart maintenance. A model is first identified using data from a system operating under normal conditions. Then the identified model is used to detect when the system begins to deviate from normal behavior. Furthermore, for systems that operate on separate batches (units), we develop a new method that identifies individual models for each batch. This can be used both to detect anomalous batches and changes in the system behavior. Finally, the two methods are evaluated on two different industrial case studies. In the first, the purpose is to detect fouling in a heat exchanger. In the second, the goal is to detect when the tool in a wood moulder machine should be changed.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755231
Abstract: In a transformerless grid-connected photovoltaic system, many issues arise from the leakage current flow into the ground, as EMI problems. The leakage current is originated from the common-mode voltage fluctuations. In this paper, the common-mode voltage harmonics in a three-phase quasi-Z-source inverter are analyzed using Fourier transform and a closed-loop formulation is presented for the harmonics value. The shoot-through mode in a quasi-Z-source inverter causes extra fluctuations in the common-mode voltage comparing to a classic inverter. The proposed harmonic analysis method provides a systematic way to figure out how shoot-through mode and also other parameters affect the common-mode voltage. As an achievement of this method, it is possible to determine the work point of the system with the minimum leakage current. The experimental results from a reduced-voltage quasi-Z-source inverter prototype are presented to confirm the theoretical analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents an outcome of a comprehensive study which evaluates the transient behaviour of point-to-point and multi-terminal high voltage direct current (MT-HVDC) networks. The behaviour of the HVDC system during a permanent pole-to-pole and pole-to-ground fault is assessed considering a range of fault resistances, fault positions along the line, and operational conditions. The emphasis of this investigation is on DC fault characteristics which would facilitate a reliable method of faulty line discrimination in a multi-terminal direct current (MTDC) system using local measurements only (i.e. assuming that no communication media is used). All the simulated waveforms (and subsequent analysis) utilise the sampling frequency of 96 kHz in compliance with IEC-61869 and IEC-61850:9-2 for DC-side voltages and currents.

doi: 10.1109/ICIT.2019.8754994
Abstract: Reduced multi-level converters have been presented to enhance the efficiency by reducing the number of components which lead to reducing the size, volume and cost of converters. Predictive control is an advanced control strategy that is implemented for control of multi-level converters due to many advantages of fast response, no need proportional gain and easy to implement. To achieve these results, this paper proposes a predictive current control technique for a single-phase reduced multi-level grid-connected converter. The proposed reduced converter is a general topology for cascaded multilevel converters that reduce the number of components and generates high number of levels than traditional multi-level configurations. The proposed topology is connected to a grid and model predictive control technique is applied to control of the grid current. The model predictive control is used in two cases for the proposed 15-level reduced converter and proposed 31-level cascaded multi-level converter. Finally, to validate of the proposed reduced multi-level converter and proposed model predictive control the simulation results are presented under MATLAB/Simulink platform for proposed both converters.

Abstract: As one of the most common species on Earth, tree plays an essential role in protecting ecological environment. Without trees large loss will occur in all aspects, such as soil erosion and climate warming, which will also harm human activities. In this case, it is vital to keep tree healthy growth to prevent the potential hazard to human. A Narrow Band-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) based tree health monitoring system is proposed in this study. It could provide effective guidance and monitoring for arborists to keep trees healthy. In this system, data collection of four various environmental features, which are thought as crucial factors in tree health, is achieved by relative sensors. Since NB-IoT has the advantages of low-power consummation and large coverage area, it is adopted to provide the transmission means for collected data and forward them to the sever for further analysis in this study. As an efficient method solving classification problems with small amount of data, K-nearest neighbors (KNN) suits this study well and is adopted. A tree health monitoring system is established finally, in which the data of environmental features are used as input to gain the health state of trees as output and the accuracy of this system could achieve 87.3%.

On the other side, model predictive controls are advanced control strategies which have many advantages for power converters applications like as fast dynamic response and easy implementation. This paper proposes a model predictive current control for a single-phase cascaded H-bridge converter topology in two modes: symmetrical and asymmetrical in the grid-connection state. The performance principle of an H-bridge converter and its cascaded connection are analyzed. Then, the mathematical model and predictive current control are explained in a grid-connected condition. The performance of the CHB topologies with the proposed predictive current control technique is evaluated by the simulation results in different conditions.

Abstract: Interleaved dc-dc boost converter (IBC) has been widely used in the fuel cell applications, due to the features of low current ripple, high efficiency and high reliability. In this paper, a voltage controller based on the extended state observer (ESO) is proposed for this converter, aiming to deal with the parameter uncertainties and the external disturbances (including the input voltage perturbation and load current disturbance). Within the proposed control, the uncertainties and disturbances are treated as the lump disturbance, which is estimated by the ESO and is then canceled in the control action in real time. The proposed controller shows strong robustness against the uncertainties and external disturbances, which is demonstrated by both the simulation and experiment results.

Abstract: A cascade control scheme is constructed combing a model predictive control (MPC) scheme as a current-mode controller with an Extended Kalman observer to control an interleaved DC-DC boost converter under load and input voltage step change conditions. A state-space average model is established and linearized near the stable point for predicting the future dynamic behavior. The process of the solving optimization problems with constraints of cost function is converted to the quadratic programming problem. An Extended Kalman observer is designed to obtain the load resistance variation and the integrated voltage error which is used to dynamically adjust the current reference. The algorithm has been tested in simulation. The results show that compared with PI controller a good transient and steady-state responses in the presence of load variations and input voltage disturbances.

Focusing on the DC-DC charging stage, this paper also provides a detailed comparison of the Dual Active Bridge (DAB) converter and the Interleaved Buck Converter (IBC), which are considered as two of the most suitable converters that can serve as a fast DC charger. Technical evaluation and comparison based on different performance indices such as volume, efficiency, number of components etc. as well as simulation of the two converters are presented. Finally, comparison results are introduced and a final discussion and conclusion are presented on which topology seems more optimum to be used as a fast DC charger.

Abstract: DC grid has been emerging as an efficient next-generation power distribution system that would enable smooth and cost-effective integration of distributed resources along with efficient use of loads. Nevertheless, this new technology poses significant challenges in terms of stability (power oscillation) and quality (resonance, ripple) at the system level. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the design aspects of DC grid components. Key basic analyses are made on the DC grid to check the stability of the system by considering the dynamic behavior of power electronic converters and associated controllers. The analysis shows that the various controller and controller parameter along with resonance frequency has a great impact on the common DC bus. Immense power oscillation is experienced when the disturbance occurred in the source side while using boost converter, in contrast, to buck converter in DC grid. Besides, the impact of disturbance in load side converter on common DC Bus is also explored. This investigation would help novice researchers in designing a stable DC grid.

Abstract: The bidirectional DC-DC converter is widely used in continuous power supply, hybrid vehicles, and battery charging. In this paper, a bidirectional quadratic boost-buck with wide input voltage range and high conversion ratio is studied. A sliding mode controller (SMC) with fixed frequency is designed. The simulation verification was conducted in the Matlab/Simulink environment. and the comparison analysis was conducted with PI algorithm. Finally, a prototype is implemented to verify the simulation. Simulation and experimental results show that the converter with sliding mode control has strong robustness and good dynamic quality under large disturbance of load and line voltage.

Abstract: This paper designs a hybrid power supply system with photovoltaic and PEMFC as the main power source and lithium battery as the auxiliary energy for electric vehicles. In order to coordinate the output power of the two power sources and the stability of the bus voltage, as well as improving the overall efficiency of the system, this paper designs a state machine energy management strategy with power compensation for the hybrid power supply system. By reducing the frequency of PEMFC output power changes and protecting the SOC of the lithium battery, the purpose of improving the service life of the PEMFC and the running time of the system is achieved. Through the efficiency analysis of the converters in the system, the output of the PEMFC and the lithium battery are adjusted to achieve the purpose of improving the overall operating efficiency of the system. Simulation results show that the designed energy management strategy can extend the system's running time and improve the overall efficiency of the system.

Abstract: With the development of renewable power generation technologies, bidirectional DC-DC converters (BDC) are being widely used in electric vehicles, micro-grid, and hybrid power system. This paper presents a floating interleaved Buck- Boost BDC (FIB-BDC), with high conversion ratio, low current ripple and low stress. Then the principle of the FIB-BDC is analyzed and the state model is built. On the other hand, the DC bus voltage is seriously disturbed by the intermittent input of renewable energy, the random disturbance of the load, and power flow switching. Therefore, a smooth robust control is designed in this paper, which is based on the hyperbolic tangent function tanh(x) with the Super-Twisting (ST) high order sliding mode control (HOSMC), so called TST-SMC or TST. It is smoother than traditional HOSMC without losing robustness and rapidity. Moreover, a dual-loop control scheme is designed for the FIB-BDC, with outer voltage loop and inner current loop. Finally, simulation experiments are tested by stepping disturbance of the load, and switching the power flow under PI, ST and TST controller. And the experimental results verified the effective of the proposed controller and the topology.

Abstract: In this paper, an innovative robust dual loop control strategy for the non-ideal Boost converter subject to load resistance disturbances and input voltage variation is successfully developed and implemented. By converting the power losses of non-ideal Boost converter into serial and parallel resistance, the equivalent circuit and its mathematical model are established. Then, for the outer voltage loop, a flatness based control incorporated with a parameters estimation technique used to estimate the unknown input voltage and output current is designed to assure tight reference voltage tracking under the extern disturbances. Meanwhile, a rigorous stability proof based on the Routh-Hurwitz criteria is given. Moreover, for the inner current loop, a simple PI controller is employed to achieving the reference current tracking. Finally, the validity and robustness of the proposed control scheme and parameters estimation accuracy are verified through numerical simulation.
